Here's how it could happen","During the Lakers' 27-point comeback victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, TV cameras caught LeBron James saying he heard his foot ""pop"" when landing from a layup. The 38-year-old was seen walking gingerly after the game despite being able to finish the win.

Just as the Lakers seem to be building some momentum with a three-game winning streak, with their stars shining and the new additions playing their part, James looks set to be in for a spell on the sidelines.

Multiple reports say the 19-time All-Star could miss several weeks, but is awaiting further tests to determine the full extent of the injury.

James posted a photo of his injured foot to his Instagram story on Monday, after it was announced he would miss the match against the Memphis Grizzlies, along with the caption: ""Fkn sucks!!!!""

Just another day in 'Laker Land' -- and it couldn't have come at a worse time.

With 21 games remaining and sitting two spots outside of a spot in the postseason's play-in tournament -- and six spots away from automatic qualification to the playoffs -- the Lakers remain in danger of missing the playoffs for the second successive season. Or will we see those famous yellow and purple uniforms in the NBA's business end of the season?

Steadily improving

For such a storied franchise and one which was crowned NBA champion just over two years ago, this season has been one full of questions and arguably not one coming up with the right answers.

Heading into the season, general manager Rob Pelinka had his work cut out to round out the team's roster, even with superstars like James and Anthony Davis on the books -- all with limited draft capital largely thanks to the widely criticized trade for Russell Westbrook.

The acquisition of Patrick Beverley in August filled a need but many pundits believed that the Lakers had not done enough to put themselves in contention to compete for a title.

Criticism from fans and pundits was even louder because of the finite amount of time it appears James has left at the top level as he approaches 40 and Pelinka's inability to build a contender around arguably the NBA's greatest player.

So the season began as many predicted, with the Lakers winning just two of their first 12 games. On November 12, the Lakers were 14th in the Western Conference.

To the credit of first-year head coach Darvin Ham and the team's leading players, the Lakers dug themselves out of a hole, winning eight of their next 10 games.

But down to a combination of injuries, lack of consistency and a lopsided roster, the Lakers struggled to kick on and make a serious surge up the standings or show their championship mettle.

Midseason trades seemed to address some of the team's issues of a lack of defense and shooting from the perimeter -- Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt, Mo Bamba and Davon Reed arriving, while Westbrook was finally shipped out.

After Sunday's win over the Mavericks, Dallas head coach Jason Kidd said Vanderbilt ""kicked our a*s.""

Since the two trades on February 9, the team has gone 4-2 and seemingly turned its season on its head.

What are chances of the Lakers in the playoffs?

In any NBA season until 2020, the Lakers' chances of competing in the playoffs would be seriously diminished with only eight teams qualifying.

But following the introduction of the play-in tournament during the bubble season in the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, a postseason berth is still within the team's grasp.

The play-in tournament whittles down the teams ranked seventh to 10th in each conference to determine the final two spots in the playoffs. The seventh seeded team hosts the eighth, with the winner earning the No. 7 seed in the playoffs.

The ninth seeded team hosts the 10th ranked side, with the winner facing the loser of the game between the seventh and eighth seeds; the winner of this game will get the eighth and final spot in the playoff bracket.

It means that at the time of writing, the Lakers are currently on a three-game winning streak, have a record of 29-32 and sit 12th in the Western Conference; a game outside the play-in tournament. They are only two-and-a-half games outside of the sixth spot which would qualify them automatically for the playoffs.

According to the website Tankathon which measures the difficulty of a team's remaining schedule for the rest of the season, the Lakers have the fifth easiest slate of games left.

It has been a far from perfect season for the Lakers so far, but it appears as if they might be coming into some form after the All-Star break.

Tied in the win column with a similarly imperfect Portland Trail Blazers, we could well be seeing the 17-time NBA champion duking it out in the play-in -- James' injury permitting.

1,1,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/16/sport/lesley-paterson-all-quiet-on-the-western-front-film-triathlon-spt-intl,How a world champion triathlete earned an Oscar nomination,"(CNN) It's while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.

A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.

She counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.

The film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer -- a young army recruit and the story's protagonist -- notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.

Unbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.

""It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film -- that the uniform's more important than the man,"" Paterson tells CNN Sport

""It's just one of those moments where you know it's good and you think: 'Oh my God ... where did this come from?' You feel so lucky that you've thought of it.""

The scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment

""If we can hold up a mirror to what's going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller -- to effect change,"" says Paterson.

Felix Kammerer stars as Paul Bäumer in ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""

First portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, ""All Quiet"" focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.

Paterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.

The end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world's first mechanized war in chilling detail.

It has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations -- including for best adapted screenplay -- and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations

The BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 -- two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.

A five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.

That was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.

With the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.

""I do a lot of one-arm drills,"" says Paterson. ""I was always really good at it and I've got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: 'Well, I can do one arm, let's give this a shot.'""

After finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.

""I just kind of kept on going,"" she says. ""And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.""

Triathlete Lesley Paterson competes for Great Britain in Birmingham, Alabama, in 2012.

The experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.

""I don't know if that's the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it's just truly I'm driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,"" she says. ""I'm a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.""

Paterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series -- ""all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,"" she says -- having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.

After she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in -- and winning -- races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get ""All Quiet"" off the ground.

""Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it's a lot of money,"" says Paterson.

""Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn't necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.""

Over the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she's doing and an obsessive attention to detail.

""I've always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,"" says Paterson.

""People think they are often very separate, but they're actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I'd say that I truly am the athlete I am because I'm an artist and the artist I am because I'm an athlete.""

""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed.

Whether it's sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of ""looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.""

It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 -- the only girl in a team of boys -- and why she chose to tackle ""All Quiet"" at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.

The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes' ""1917"" four years ago.

And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching ""All Quiet"" in German, rather than English.

""There's an authenticity -- it's their story, it's their national novel, it's rightly so that it's in German,"" says Paterson.

The popularity of ""All Quiet"" may take Paterson's life in a different direction, especially now that she's 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.

Whatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.

""It's focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes -- that was a huge learning curve for me,"" she says.

""As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you're at ... That's where the beauty comes.""",['George Ramsay'],2023-02-16,"it's while running in the moors and hills of her native scotland that lesley paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.a professional triathlete and screenwriter, paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. but in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.she counts among those the opening scenes of the oscar-nominated ""all quiet on the western front,"" an adaptation of erich maria remarque's anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.the film begins in the trenches of the first world war, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in germany. there, paul bumer -- a young army recruit and the story's protagonist -- notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.unbeknownst to bumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.""it really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film -- that the uniform's more important than the man,"" paterson tells cnn sport""it's just one of those moments where you know it's good and you think: 'oh my god ... where did this come from?' you feel so lucky that you've thought of it.""the scene, first visualized on a run in the scottish highlands, proved prescient. last year, russian soldiers fighting in ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment""if we can hold up a mirror to what's going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller -- to effect change,"" says paterson.felix kammerer stars as paul bumer in ""all quiet on the western front.""first portrayed on screen in a much-loved hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, ""all quiet"" focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.paterson, alongside writing partner ian stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before netflix commissioned it as a german-language film.the end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the armistice talks between german and french officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world's first mechanized war in chilling detail.it has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine oscar nominations -- including for best adapted screenplay -- and a record-equaling 14 bafta nominationsthe bafta awards ceremony will be held on sunday, while the oscars take place on march 13 -- two events that, for paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.a five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.that was in 2016, when paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in costa rica. partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.with the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.""i do a lot of one-arm drills,"" says paterson.

2,2,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/sport/damian-lillard-71-points-record-nba-spt-intl,Damian Lillard becomes first player in NBA history to score over 70 points in under 40 minutes,"(CNN) Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

""I enjoy those moments in the game when I'm just going after people,"" the NBA All-Star said after the game. ""That's all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.""

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell's 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting -- even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts -- just one off Klay Thompson's record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard's teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell's total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

""It really, really was a masterful performance,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star's game. ""It was a piece of art. That was incredible.""

Any postgame celebrations for Lillard were cut short after he was picked for a drug test.

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain's record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

""I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you're hot, you're in attack mode, you're feeling good,"" he said.

Not only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.

The Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.

3,3,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/football/super-league-documentary-football-jeff-zimbalist-spt-intl,A 'political thriller' filled with personal betrayals. The inside story of the Super League and the war for soccer's soul,"(CNN) Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming -- just ask Julius Caesar, who asked ""Et tu Brute?"" as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition -- the Champions League -- are akin to a 'House of Cards' plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe's biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body's UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams -- the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary ""Super League: The War for Football,"" the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a ""political thriller ... 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,"" its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles -- or its future -- and, most stingingly of all, ""betrayal"" between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter's godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was ""sort of the general of the opposing army,"" Zimbalist says.

""The dynamics at play here aren't that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,"" he adds. ""The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.""

Aleksander Čeferin was elected UEFA President in 2016.

Characters -- normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews -- are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother's death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez's about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi's about his tennis playing days.

""This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,"" Zimbalist says. ""These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

""We were watching what's usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.""

'Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?'

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs -- all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to ""drop a legislative bomb"" to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

Andrea Agnelli was replaced by Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the chairman of the European Club Association.

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects' reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

""That was how we presented it to them,"" Zimbalist says.

""We're going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they're rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.""

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

""You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,"" he says. ""But then you're leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.""

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport's most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football's magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

Real Madrid won the 2022 Champions League.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

""This identity crisis in the sport -- is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?"" Zimbalist says. ""If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn't fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.""

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the ""cynical project,"" as seemingly, did football's world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA's more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

'The war for football rages on'

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with ""60 to 80 teams"" earlier this month.

Zimbalist's documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by ""old money"" clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by ""new money"" club such as PSG and Manchester City.

""We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,"" he says.

""And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?""

Giorgio Marchetti is the Deputy General Secretary of UEFA.

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team's representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors -- including Agnelli -- resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor's office in Turin.

Barcelona's already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become ""a reality in 2025.""

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN's Richard Quest last month that for them, ""the Super League is in the past.""

""It was something that we apologized for and ... going forward, it's not something that we're interested in.""

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league's fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the ""ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,"" Zimbalist says.

""Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.""",['Issy Ronald'],2023-02-27,"betrayal has formed part of european politics since polities started forming -- just ask julius caesar, who asked ""et tu brute?"" as his friend stabbed him for the good of the roman republic.fast forward to april 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed european super league (esl) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition -- the champions league -- are akin to a 'house of cards' plot.driven by 12 of europe's biggest clubs, the esl intended to break away from european soccer governing body's uefa to create their own competition containing 20 teams -- the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.in the apple tv+ documentary ""super league: the war for football,"" the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a ""political thriller ... 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,"" its emmy-award winning director jeff zimbalist tells cnn sports.featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles -- or its future -- and, most stingingly of all, ""betrayal"" between friends.the friendship between uefa president aleksander eferin and andrea agnelli, then juventus chairman and european club association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.initially so close that agnelli named eferin his daughter's godfather as they worked together on reforming european football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that agnelli had helped formulate the rival esl and was ""sort of the general of the opposing army,"" zimbalist says.""the dynamics at play here aren't that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,"" he adds.

4,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/22/football/palestianian-national-soccer-team-world-cup-spt-intl,"All eyes were on Morocco at the last World Cup. Now, Palestinian national team wants a slice of the action at 2026 tournament","(CNN) The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory's presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting ""free Palestine,"" while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel's creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel's capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel's creation -- in what Palestinians call the ""Nakba"" and Israelis call Independence Day -- clashes have been frequent.

Rami Hamadeh plays for the Palestianian national team against Jordan at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, AFC Asian Cup.

""Nakba"" means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

""The Israeli occupation doesn't just affect me, but affects ... Palestinian sports in general,"" the Palestinian team's goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

""Whether it's players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.""

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian football player Mahmoud Sarsak, who staged a hunger strike of nearly three months while in Israeli jail, is surrounded by relatives and supporters at the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on July 10, 2012 upon his release from prison.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel's ""illegal combatant"" policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said ""I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.""

But last year's AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

""The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It's the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,"" the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes' movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was ""clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.""

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

Makram Daboub (C) became the Palestinian national team's official coach in 2021.

The politics of travel

Nicknamed the ""Lions of Canaan"" and the ""Fedayeen,"" the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

""Our training base is in the West Bank, and I'm able to watch the matches here. But I can't watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can't come to the West Bank either,"" said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

""Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,"" Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, ""Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.""

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team's official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

""We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,"" said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer's world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won't be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

Morocco's Ismail El Haddad and Palestinian Yaser Hamed contest the ball in an Arab Cup game in December 2021.

""I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,"" said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

'Love of football'

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup -- the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages -- Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

""When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it's from the Palestinian bloodline,"" Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain's national football team if he's called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

""I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I'm proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It's like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,"" said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

The president of the Palestinian FA Jibril Rajoub holding a press conference with IOC President Thomas Bach (not seen) after their meeting in Ramallah, West Bank, on September 19, 2022.

The PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad's first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players' health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

""To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,"" said Shaheen.

""The nutritional support that's added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,"" Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been ""shining"" in the Portuguese league.

Oday Dabbagh, who plays club football in Portugal, is pictured playing for the Palestinian national team against Song Kum Song of North Korea during the 2018 AFC Under-23 Championship in Jiangyin city, east China's Jiangsu province, in January 2018.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA -- he plays for Portugal's F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team's future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn't always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel's control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association's (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn't violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its ""FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.""

Additionally, FIFA's football infrastructure projects ""include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,"" according to FIFA.

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, back right, and President of the Palestine Olympic Committee Jibril Rajoub, second right, back, meet with young Palestinian athletes at Faisal Al-Husseini stadium in the West Bank city of Al-Ram, north of Jerusalem, in September 2022.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces ""won't stop us from our plans.""

""This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,"" said Hilal.

""There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it's known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,"" Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn't hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.

While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.

""There's a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,"" said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

""For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,""

Coach Daboub goes even further.

gianni infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that fifa was reconsidering the 48-team world cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer's world governing body told cnn sports the structure won't be changing anytime soon.this will give the number of asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 fifa world cup, and more possibilities for the palestinian

according to the pfa -- he plays for portugal's f.c. arouca and will be transferring to belgian league r. charleroi s.c in june of this year.shaheen and the pfa believe this addition will elevate the palestinian team's future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.infrastructure projectsthe football team received fifa membership in 1998 after several attempts. however the relationship between the pfa and fifa hasn't always been smooth.over the years, the pfa has filed numerous complaints to fifa and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with israel's control over palestinian sports.in 2015, the pfa called for the suspension of the israel football association's (ifa) membership with fifa.they accused israel of restricting movements of palestinian players in the west bank and objected to israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the west bank.fifa said israel didn't violate any rules which led the pfa to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by fifa delegates.despite these tensions with the pfa, the world governing body pointed out that through its ""fifa forward programme and in addition to operational funding, fifa has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the palestinians.""additionally, fifa's football infrastructure projects ""include the installation of a futsal hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at faisal al-husseini

6,6,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/24/sport/boxing-olympics-chaos-iba-usa-spt-intl,Infighting in the sport and Russia's invasion of Ukraine leaves Olympic boxing on the ropes,"(CNN) It's an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible ""sabotage,"" saying the IBA had announced a ""false and misleading"" qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women's and men's world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA's running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the ""ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.""

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to ""come together and work together as a unit"" so it can ""continue to fight for our Olympic future.""

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be ""fundamental change"" before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body's decision was ""taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.""

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA's ""financial dependency"" on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the ""continuing and very concerning issues"" over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been ""dealing with significant governance issues,"" which it said were a ""burden from the past leadership.""

""We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC's upper echelon,"" the statement added.

""This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.""

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women's and men's world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be ""main qualification events"" for Paris 2024.

The IBA's announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation's banners -- or competing in general -- in many sports following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin's troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as ""neutral athletes.""

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other ""like-minded"" countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries -- including the UK, Canada and most of Europe -- said in a joint statement that there is ""no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.""

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the ""Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.""

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to ""use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.""

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA's announcement, saying ""the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024's boxing qualifications and tournament.""

The statement said the IBA's suspension was ""still in force"" and that ""the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.""

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA's announcement of qualifying tournaments ""totally unacceptable"" and said it ""clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.""

""IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,"" he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained ""committed to the Olympic movement"" by following the IOC's principles of ""proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.""

On Wednesday, Ukraine's boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA's world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men's and women's championships.

""Our answer is clear -- our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,"" Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

Ilchenko added: ""As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country ... they will not participate.""",['Ben Morse'],2023-02-24,"it's an olympic sport which has

7,7,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/23/sport/campbell-johnstone-all-blacks-rugby-spt-intl,"As a rugby player, Campbell Johnstone 'pushed away' his sexuality. Now, he wants to open the door for more people to come out","(CNN) During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with ""the best right shoulder in the game,"" according to one of his former coaches.

He played three times for the All Blacks -- a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand -- and represented club teams at home and overseas.

But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.

""I loved playing rugby,"" he tells CNN Sport . ""And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.

""That didn't fit the picture and that wasn't part of my plan. I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn't address it -- just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.""

Last month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.

The response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for ""blazing this trail"" and inspiring ""future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.""

""So many people have sent messages of support,"" says Johnstone. ""Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.

""In that respect, it's been really overwhelming and so positive.""

Johnstone played for the Ospreys in Wales, as well as clubs in New Zealand and France.

On top of his three Tests for the All Blacks in 2005, Johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for Canterbury and 38 times for the Crusaders. He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.

Now, the 43-year-old says he is ""at peace"" in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn't believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.

""It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,"" says Johnstone. ""Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn't be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.

""I'd go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I'd go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I'd come home and realize that I'm not actually being truthful to my teammates.""

Former referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.

Both Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer , who came out as gay in 2020, said he ""routinely numbed"" himself with a ""heavy cocktail of opioids"" during his playing career.

But Johnstone is optimistic about rugby's future.

""As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it'll progress very well,"" he says.

""I think rugby is a living culture and it's always progressing and it's progressing in the right directions.""

Johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days -- largely because he's always been a private person and ""wasn't 100% comfortable"" with his sexuality at the time.

He's now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.

""I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: 'Yeah, okay, let's address it and take away that stigma,' because there's always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.

""If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.""

After retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.

He recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team -- something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.

""That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,"" says Johnstone, ""and you'll get better results, I believe.""",['George Ramsay'],2023-02-23,"during his rugby career, campbell johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with ""the best right shoulder in the game,"" according to one of his former coaches.he played three times for the all blacks -- a dream for thousands of young rugby players in new zealand -- and represented club teams at home and overseas.but for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.""i loved playing rugby,"" he tells cnn sport .

""here was this game and this sport that i loved and enjoyed so much, yet i couldn't be myself. and i felt i was living a double life, basically.""i'd go home and then the anxiety would rise and then i'd go out the door, go to training. but that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. then i'd come home and realize that i'm not actually being truthful to my teammates.""former referee nigel owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former wales international gareth thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.both owens and thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former australia international dan palmer , who came out as gay in 2020, said he ""routinely numbed"" himself with a ""heavy cocktail of opioids"" during his playing career.but johnstone is optimistic about rugby's future.""as long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then i think it'll progress very well,"" he says.""i think rugby is a living culture and it's always progressing and it's progressing in the right directions.""johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days -- largely because he's always been a private person and ""wasn't 100% comfortable"" with his sexuality at the time.he's now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.""i was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so i thought: 'yeah, okay, let's address it and take away that stigma,' because there's always been this stigma around the all blacks and who is the first one and things like that.""if we can open that door and i can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.""after retiring from rugby, johnstone undertook coaching roles in spain, the us and new zealand.he recently visited one of his former clubs, the crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team -- something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.""that, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,"" says johnstone, ""and you'll get better results, i believe."""

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and the Serbian, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

""Look, last year I did miss both Indian Wells, Miami and all the US Open swing,"" 22-time grand slam winner Djokovic told reporters in Belgrade on Wednesday.

""So it wouldn't be the first time if it does happen. I mean, I hope it doesn't, but that's all I can do. All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There's not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,"" he said.

The Serbian tennis star told reporters in Belgrade that he would ""love to be there"" at this year's US Open.

Casting an eye to the US Open grand slam at the end of August, the 35-year-old said: ""Well, (the) US Open is still far away, you know, it's six months away.

9,9,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/25/football/alyssa-thompson-nwsl-draft-world-cup-spt-intl,"High schooler by day, professional soccer player by night: Alyssa Thompson is doing it all","(CNN) Most No. 1 draft picks have time to enjoy their success, celebrating with family and friends, or dreaming about their future professional sports careers.

Not so for soccer star Alyssa Thompson , who had to think about the more pressing matter of her classes the next morning.

The 18-year-old Thompson made headlines when she was selected as the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NWSL draft by Angel City FC in January, becoming the first high schooler in history to be drafted in the history of the league.

""I was very nervous,"" she tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies.

""And just like all the emotions were coming to me at that moment. I just was really shocked and couldn't believe this is really happening right now.""

Not to be overwhelmed by her status as a new NWSL star, the senior at Harvard-Westlake is adamant that she is still focused on school, even if she has to juggle her studies with a professional soccer career.

""Once I'm done with practice, I don't have another thing to do. So I think I'll do my schoolwork,"" she says. ""As long as it gets me to graduate, I'll do it.""

Thompson is no stranger to balancing school and soccer -- whether its weekend trips to tournaments or training camps -- and in October she went one better, making her debut for the US Women's National Team in a friendly against European Champion England in London.

In front of a packed-out Wembley Stadium, Thompson was subbed on for USWNT superstar Megan Rapinoe, a moment that will stay with her for life.

Alyssa Thompson made her debut for the national team as a substitute for Megan Rapinoe.

""That was so crazy! I don't know how to describe it. I was just really nervous, and I was going in for Megan Rapinoe!"" she recalls. ""I don't think I was even processing it in the moment.""

Thompson will have to get used to lining up with the biggest stars in the sport. Angel City boasts a line-up of celebrity owners, including Serena Williams, Natalie Portman, Becky G, Eva Longoria and Mia Hamm.

And the stars are not limited to the sidelines. When the NWSL season kicks off next month, Thompson will be a part of an all-star team featuring two-time world champion Christen Press and Thompson's personal hero Sydney Leroux.

Inspiring on and off the field

Thompson is not only breaking records as the first high school No. 1 draft pick. She also became the first player of Peruvian and Filipino heritage to be picked at No. 1, something that is not lost on her.

Despite her youth, Thompson doesn't simply want to play soccer, but she also wants to be the inspiration for the next generation of girls playing the game.

""I think that being able to be a woman of color just as a role model for little girls is such an amazing thing,"" she tells CNN Sport. ""Being able to look up to someone that looks like them is such a cool thing to have.""

Thompson is used to being a role model having served as one for her younger sisters, Gisele and Zoe, her whole life. Both want to emulate Thompson's success.

Gisele is already on that path after becoming the first high school player, along with Alyssa, to sign a name, image and likeness deal with Nike. She also has emulated her older sister by playing for the USWNT youth teams, featuring at the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup.

Alyssa Thompson will hope make her debut for Angel City next month when the NWSL season kicks off.

The pair have been inseparable, playing together from when they could walk all the way to the present, where they have featured together for the Total Futbol Academy of MLS Next, a boys' team in Southern California.

Despite Thompson's youth, she already sees herself as far more than just an athlete -- someone who has the power to inspire a new generation of soccer players in the US.

""For my youngest sister, Zoe, being able to just be an inspiration for her and a role model for her to look up to, I think has really helped me put things into perspective for what I really want to do and how I want to be a role model for little kids,"" she says.

While making her NSWL debut in Los Angeles is first on Thompson's to-do list, the far bigger prize is in Australia and New Zealand in the shape of the Women's World Cup, which kicks off in July.

Having tasted international senior soccer in October and now training regularly with USWNT players at club level, Thompson is hungry to be a part of the biggest showpiece in women's soccer.

It's a tall order for the young striker. The US boasts the deepest pool of players to choose from of any team and is coming into the tournament as the reigning champion, albeit on a low ebb.

Both of Thompson's appearances for the team came in losses to England and Spain before the US lost to Germany, marking the first time the team has lost three games in a row since 1993.

Head coach Vlatko Andonovski has very little margin for error as he looks to lead the US to a third consecutive title and Thompson will have to seriously impress if she wants to make it onto the plane heading across the Pacific.

""I'm going to do everything that I can to be able to make the roster and I'm just going to work hard towards that goal,"" Thompson says.

""If I continue to grow as a player and continue to thrive in the NWSL environment, then I feel like I have a chance.""

A slim chance, maybe, but Thompson is no stranger to making the seemingly impossible look routine.","['Amanda Davies', 'Alasdair Howorth']",2023-02-25,"most no. 1 draft picks have time to enjoy their success, celebrating with family and friends, or dreaming about their future professional sports careers.not so for soccer star alyssa thompson , who had to think about the more pressing matter of her classes the next morning.the 18-year-old thompson made headlines when she was selected as the no. 1 pick in the 2023 nwsl draft by angel city fc in january, becoming the first high schooler in history to be drafted in the history of the league.""i was very nervous,"" she tells cnn sport's amanda davies.""and just like all the emotions were coming to me at that moment. i just was really shocked and couldn't believe this is really happening right now.""not to be overwhelmed by her status as a new nwsl star, the senior at harvard-westlake is adamant that she is still focused on school, even if she has to juggle her studies with a professional soccer career.""once i'm done with practice, i don't have another thing to do. so i think i'll do my schoolwork,"" she says.

Sometimes a flock of enthusiastic fans in Tiger onesies is the height of stylistic expression at a PGA Tour event.

Yet every now and then, a budding fairway fashionista pushes the envelope and makes a wardrobe decision that proves that golf can, in fact, serve up some memorable looks.

Whether they are memorable for the right reasons is another debate entirely. While Payne Stewart's sartorial elegance and seemingly bottomless wardrobe of knickers saw his fashion reputation transcend golf, there was also the wearable eyesore that was Team USA's 1999 Ryder Cup outfit -- so bad that Tiger Woods confessed to burning it for warmth.

14,14,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/golf/chris-kirk-alcoholism-depression-honda-classic-spt-intl,Chris Kirk battled alcoholism and depression -- now he has secured his first PGA Tour victory in seven years,"(CNN) It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour. Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday, that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind.

A nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American's fifth PGA Tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.

""I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety,"" Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort.

""I wouldn't be doing this for a living anymore. I probably wouldn't have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.

""For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.

""It's something that's constantly on my mind, so it's pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.""

Kirk during the final round.

'I got sober because of you'

On the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019, Kirk announced he would be taking an ""indefinite leave"" from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.

""I thought I could control it, but after multiple relapses, I have come to realize I can't fix this on my own,"" Kirk added in a social media post.

By that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.

A tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk's sole top-40 finish of the campaign.

When he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further -- he was world No. 303 -- but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.

candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer's previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.

Kirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to ""accelerate"" his alcohol issues.

For Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.

Kirk is congratulated by his caddie after victory.

""It's been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, 'I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],"" Kirk said.

""When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more ... for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.

""So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.

""But now on the back end a little bit, it's been amazing. Like I said, it's not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and ... for somebody to say, 'I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,' you can't really describe how unreal that is with words.""

Augusta calling

On Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.

The American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot -- ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event -- who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.

For both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.

Again, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.

When Cole's birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip's hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.

As well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday's triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.

""I've been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that's going to be something that's incredibly special,"" Kirk said.

""That par-3 contest can't come soon enough. I'm really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.""

On Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.

Paul, a 26-year-old American with more than 20 million YouTube subscribers, is now 6-1 while Fury, the British younger half-brother of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury , remains undefeated with nine wins after taking time out of his boxing career in 2019 to star in reality show ""Love Island.""

Millions of fans were expected to tune into the fight, the latest pay-per-view bout involving a YouTuber to generate a social media buzz as promoters played up the bad blood between the two fighters. And just like a genuine world title fight, there were plenty of stars ringside, including former champ Mike Tyson, soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and comedian Kevin Hart.

Fury asserted his jab early to keep Paul at a distance but the YouTuber gained momentum in the fifth round, appearing to stun Fury.

Both had points deducted -- Paul in the fifth for pushing his opponent's head down while clinching and Fury in the sixth for too much clinching, a defensive tactic that's often only allowed for short periods of time.

Mike Tyson is seen before the fight in Riyadh's Diriyah Arena, Saudi Arabia.

Fury was knocked down in the eighth round on a short-left hand by Paul but it was too late as the judges ruled in Fury's favor.

Paul said he intended to use a rematch clause for Sunday's fight that could be exercised if Fury won.

""All respect to Tommy, he won, don't judge me by my wins, judge me by my losses. I'll come back, I thought I deserve that rematch, it was a great fight, a close fight,"" Paul said after the fight.

Because not just once, but twice during his third round, American golfer Akshay Bhatia was forced into an impromptu wardrobe change at the PGA National Resort in Palm Beach, Florida.

The first came at the sixth hole, when the 21-year-old's tee drive settled in the muddy banks on the left of the fairway. A shirtless shot followed as Bhatia successfully scooped his ball back onto the fairway, the splashes of mud across his chest suggesting that the shirt removal was a smart decision.

A superb approach and putt saw the world No. 357 save par superbly, yet despite the best efforts of his caddie and a towel, the hole had left its mark on Bhatia. Fortunately, his girlfriend was on hand with a change of clothes, and the golfer pushed on with his round.

Bhatia tracks his shot from the sixth hole.

Bhatia had been riding the wave of an excellent second round, but effectively saw any chance of a first PGA Tour victory collapse across four holes. A run of bogey, par, double bogey and bogey saw Bhatia arrive at the par-three 15th hole needing a big response, only for his tee shot to sail over the flag and into the swampy area behind the green.

37,37,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/26/us/aaron-rodgers-darkness-retreat-wellness-ctpr,NFL star Aaron Rodgers went to a darkness retreat to contemplate his future. What is that and how does it work?,"(CNN) For four days this week, home for Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was a pitch-black room. There were no phones, no television, no lights or distractions. Just Rodgers, alone with his thoughts, in a cabin built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark.

When the four-time NFL MVP announced plans earlier this month to contemplate his NFL future in isolation at a ""darkness retreat,"" many were left scratching their heads.

""It's just sitting in isolation, meditation, dealing with your thoughts,"" Rodgers said earlier this month . ""We rarely even turn our phone off or put the blinds down to sleep in darkness. I'm really looking forward to it.""

Rodgers is no stranger to alternative therapies. He credits psychedelics like psilocybin and ayahuasca for helping to alleviate his fear of death and deepening a sense of self-love. The football star said he has done ""many meditation and yoga retreats"" in the past and defended his decision to try darkness therapy as one of several practices ""that have stimulated my mind and helped me get in a better headspace and have a greater peace in my life.""

But what exactly happens in a darkness retreat? And is it just another new-age fad or perhaps something that could benefit the rest of us?

What happens in the dark

A darkness retreat is exactly what it sounds like: a prolonged stay in a space completely devoid of light. One of the centers offering the practice is Sky Cave Retreats , nestled in the Cascade-Siskiyou wilderness, in Southern Oregon, near Klamath Falls.

The cabins are built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark.

""The reasons for doing this range from people wanting to know themselves more, to people who want to rest, reset and relax, to those who want to explore consciousness and deepen their meditation practice,"" said Scott Berman, who owns Sky Cave Retreats along with his wife Jill, adding the darkness helps illuminate what really matters by stripping away the constant bombardment of sensory input and stimulation many people experience in their hectic modern lives.

""When someone goes into the darkness, all these things that were important to them like money, fame, power, status, being worthy -- they all become insignificant and meaningless in the dark,"" Berman said. ""In the dark, all you have is the present moment which reveals what is truly meaningful -- whether it's love, forgiveness, peace -- and it begins to transform you as you truly authentically touch what is most important to you.""

The center currently operates three stand-alone cabins built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark -- earth-sheltered caves, which on the outside are somewhat reminiscent of a Hobbit home. Each space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation. Participants can leave at any time -- the doors are never locked -- and there is a light switch for emergencies which is protected by a childproof guard so it isn't flipped on by accident.

The cost includes three meals a day, which Berman delivers personally all at once in the evening (through a lightproof double-sided food box) to minimize the disturbance. This is when participants have an opportunity for a conversation, which could be 10 seconds or 30 minutes, according to Berman, depending on the person's needs.

Participants typically spend three to four days in the darkness at a cost of $250 a night and are encouraged to take an extra day before and after to integrate the experience.

Each space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation.

Burak Dalcik, a 27-year-old salesman from Arlington, Virginia, said the four days he spent in the dark at Sky Caves Retreats in January gave him clarity about his priorities. He found he no longer labeled experiences as positive or negative, but rather allowed them to come and to go, which led to less stress and anxiety at work and in his personal life. He also said he started calling his mom, who lives back in Turkey, more frequently.

""It just really trims all the unnecessary fat and allows you to focus on some of the most important things and really allows you to understand who you are,"" said Dalcik. ""There's nothing New Age about this -- it boils down to can you just sit by yourself with yourself? And if you can't, you should probably get pretty curious about why.""

Berman cautions the retreat isn't for everyone, nor should it be seen as a quick fix to one's troubles.

""It's not like this magical, mind-blowing, amazing experience -- it can be extremely difficult and uncomfortable,"" Berman said. ""But in the darkness, discomfort is the door to transformation. There's an acceptance and a profound love that people start to experience when they're no longer resisting that part of themselves.""

A therapeutic tool or junk science?

For now, there is limited research on how darkness retreats impact the human brain and body. Some centers claim the experience can help heal traumas or activate the pineal gland, another claim is darkness therapy increases melatonin production in the brain.

""That's totally false,"" said Dr. David Blask, the head of the Laboratory of Chrono-Neuroendocrine Oncology at Tulane University School of Medicine. ""There may be some psychological benefits that people derive from a darkness retreat that they feel are important for them, but certainly not from a strict endocrine neuroendocrine or biochemical physiological standpoint.""

Dr. Marek Malůš, a psychologist at the University of Ostrava in the Czech Republic who has been studying darkness therapies since 2010, sees the technique as a promising therapeutic tool.

""Your thoughts, memories, emotions, inner world and mental processes become much more balanced and integrated,"" Malůš said.

While he and his colleagues are working to secure funding for additional studies, Malůš said preliminary research showed just four days in a darkness chamber was enough to help increase mindfulness and self-esteem, lower symptoms of depression and anxiety, while improving parasympathetic nervous system functions, which helps with stress management and lowering burnout symptoms. Subjects reported feeling the benefits three weeks after the experience.

Berman said he hopes to see more scientific research into the benefits of darkness retreats, but cautions against anyone seeking to use the retreat for some sort of natural high.

""If somebody's coming here because they want to have a so-called DMT experience, you've come into the wrong place,"" he said. ""But there is a lot of benefit in not looking outside of ourselves for confirmation of our worth and using the darkness to illuminate our true nature.""

For those who aren't able to commit the time or money for a darkness retreat but want a taste of some of the benefits, Berman suggests starting small at home.

""It's about becoming accustomed to authentically slowing down, putting the phone away, turning out the lights, closing the blinds and just resting,"" he said. ""Not to get somewhere, not to heal but just to be curious about what's actually happening within yourself.""",['Lucy Kafanov'],2023-02-26,"for four days this week, home for green bay packers quarterback aaron rodgers was a pitch-black room. there were no phones, no television, no lights or distractions. just rodgers, alone with his thoughts, in a cabin built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark.when the four-time nfl mvp announced plans earlier this month to contemplate his nfl future in isolation at a ""darkness retreat,"" many were left scratching their heads.""it's just sitting in isolation, meditation, dealing with your thoughts,"" rodgers said earlier this month .

""in the dark, all you have is the present moment which reveals what is truly meaningful -- whether it's love, forgiveness, peace -- and it begins to transform you as you truly authentically touch what is most important to you.""the center currently operates three stand-alone cabins built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark -- earth-sheltered caves, which on the outside are somewhat reminiscent of a hobbit home. each space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation. participants can leave at any time -- the doors are never locked -- and there is a light switch for emergencies which is protected by a childproof guard so it isn't flipped on by accident.the cost includes three meals a day, which berman delivers personally all at once in the evening (through a lightproof double-sided food box) to minimize the disturbance. this is when participants have an opportunity for a conversation, which could be 10 seconds or 30 minutes, according to berman, depending on the person's needs.participants typically spend three to four days in the darkness at a cost of $250 a night and are encouraged to take an extra day before and after to integrate the experience.each space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation.burak dalcik, a 27-year-old salesman from arlington, virginia, said the four days he spent in the dark at sky caves retreats in january gave him clarity about his priorities. he found he no longer labeled experiences as positive or negative, but rather allowed them to come and to go, which led to less stress and anxiety at work and in his personal life. he also said he started calling his mom, who lives back in turkey, more frequently.""it just really trims all the unnecessary fat and allows you to focus on some of the most important things and really allows you to understand who you are,"" said dalcik. ""there's nothing new age about this -- it boils down to can you just sit by yourself with yourself? and if you can't, you should probably get pretty curious about why.""berman cautions the retreat isn't for everyone, nor should it be seen as a quick fix to one's troubles.""it's not like this magical, mind-blowing, amazing experience -- it can be extremely difficult and uncomfortable,"" berman said. ""but in the darkness, discomfort is the door to transformation. there's an acceptance and a profound love that people start to experience when they're no longer resisting that part of themselves.""a therapeutic tool or junk science?for now, there is limited research on how darkness retreats impact the human brain and body. some centers claim the experience can help heal traumas or activate the pineal gland, another claim is darkness therapy increases melatonin production in the brain.""that's totally false,"" said dr. david blask, the head of the laboratory of chrono-neuroendocrine oncology at tulane university school of medicine. ""there may be some psychological benefits that people derive from a darkness retreat that they feel are important for them, but certainly not from a strict endocrine neuroendocrine or biochemical physiological standpoint.""dr. marek mal, a psychologist at the university of ostrava in the czech republic who has been studying darkness therapies since 2010, sees the technique as a promising therapeutic tool.""your thoughts, memories, emotions, inner world and mental processes become much more balanced and integrated,"" mal said.while he and his colleagues are working to secure funding for additional studies, mal said preliminary research showed just four days in a darkness chamber was enough to help increase mindfulness and self-esteem, lower symptoms of depression and anxiety, while improving parasympathetic nervous system functions, which helps with stress management and lowering burnout symptoms. subjects reported feeling the benefits three weeks after the experience.berman said he hopes to see more scientific research into the benefits of darkness retreats, but cautions against anyone seeking to use the retreat for some sort of natural high.""if somebody's coming here because they want to have a so-called dmt experience, you've come into the wrong place,"" he said. ""but there is a lot of benefit in not looking outside of ourselves for confirmation of our worth and using the darkness to illuminate our true nature.""for those who aren't able to commit the time or money for a darkness retreat but want a taste of some of the benefits, berman suggests starting small at home.""it's about becoming accustomed to authentically slowing down, putting the phone away, turning out the lights, closing the blinds and just resting,"" he said.

Casemiro broke the deadlock minutes after the half-hour mark, heading home from a Luke Shaw freekick.

Five minutes later, the lead was doubled after Marcus Rashford looked to have continued his electric form when his deflected strike just evaded Lorius Karius to fly into the Newcastle goal despite the German's despairing fingertips -- it was later ruled to be a Sven Botman own goal.

The trophy cements an excellent turnaround under Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag who has transformed the club from perennial underachievers to trophy winners in just over 10 months.

""It's an amazing feeling, we've been searching for this moment, us, the fans, the club, finally we get our trophy, we deserve it,"" Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes told Sky Sports just moments after the final whistle.

""It's been an amazing period. The first trophy of the season but we want more. It's not enough for this club, we want more and we need more because our standards deserve more.""

Turnaround

It was a final longtime coming for both teams for different reasons.

For Manchester United, the club hasn't won a trophy since 2017; a cataclysmic expanse for the club the size of it.

In the black and white of Newcastle, it is an even longer wait, having not won any major silverware for 54 years.

The PIF -- which has an 80% stake in the club, as part of a three-party consortium -- is a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, the man who a US intelligence report named responsible for approving the operation that led to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

With thousands of fans having made the journey down to London from Newcastle for the final, Wembley's atmosphere had a proper cup final feel to it.

And to the delight of Manchester United fans, their local hero and the team's man in form, Rashford, was declared fit to start despite a recent injury scare. Newcastle was without its own star player in goalkeeper Nick Pope who had been shown a red card in his previous game meaning he was suspended.

In the opening few minutes, and in a crackling atmosphere, there was very little between the two teams, with Newcastle's Allan Saint-Maximin going closest after some trademark quick footwork.

When it looked as if Newcastle might be building up a head of steam, it was sucker punched when a free kick from out wide was headed past Karius by Casemiro.

The Brazilian midfielder was signed by manager Ten Hag in a £60 million ($73m) deal from Real Madrid in the summer and his impact as the heart of the team has been indicative of Manchester United's rise since Ten Hag's arrival at the club.

Things went from bad to worse for Newcastle minutes later when some neat link up play between Rashford and Wout Weghorst saw the England star played into the opposition's box. Although he was able to get away a left-footed shot under pressure from Botman, Rashford's shot looked to have been heading wide meaning the goal was credited to the Netherlands defender.

After the halftime break, Newcastle ramped up its pressure on David de Gea's goal, with Saint-Maximin and the newly-introduced Alexander Isak doing their best to fashion goalscoring opportunities.

The final two minutes were filled with set pieces, substitutions and breakaway chances -- with Manchester United actually looking the most likely to score.

In the dying seconds, with the result seemingly wrapped up, Portugal international Fernandes had a glorious opportunity to cap off a memorable afternoon, only for Karius to produce a smart stop.

In the end, Manchester United was able to run down the remainder of the clock, end its six-year trophy wait -- the club's longest wait for a major trophy since 1983 -- and possibly usher in a new era at the club.

""It's a mixture of all the emotions. It's massive for us to be involved in these types of games. it's something we've missed as a club,"" Rashford told Sky Sports afterwards.

""The fact we've come all this way and won it, it's a massive feeling. Hopefully it pushes us now to keep going. There's hunger to add more finals like this. I've been in finals where we've won and lost. It's massive for us as a club and individuals and it's part of our history. We want to keep adding to that.""

He added: ""We want to be involved in a lot of games and that means we've got to stay in the competitions. If we want to win things, we have to keep pushing.""

63,63,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/02/sport/nfl-scouting-combine-2023-preview-spt-intl,2023 NFL scouting combine: Everything you need to know,"(CNN) It's that time of year when hope is plentiful and everything looks a bit brighter.

Yes, it is the beginning of spring , but it is also the start of the NFL offseason whose first major event is the scouting combine.

The showpiece stage for draft hopefuls welcomes the beginning of prediction season and marks when last year's disappointments change into this year's reasons for optimism.

Stars can solidify their status at the top while unheralded prospects can surprise everyone with their athletic displays; it is impossible to predict what will happen when this year's standout college players are put through their paces at the invitation-only affair.

So before the biggest event for teams to evaluate players ahead of next month's draft in Kansas City, here's all you need to know about this year's combine:

How to watch

The NFL scouting combine is the pinnacle for many prospects hoping to be drafted into the professional league so they will be aiming to impress on the biggest stage.

Coverage of the scouting combine is exclusively shown on the NFL Network, which will broadcast all four days.

'The ultimate four-day job interview'

As is tradition, this year's combine is held in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis -- the home of the Indianapolis Colts.

Having begun in 1982 when Indianapolis-based National Football Scouting Inc. (NFS) conducted the first National Invitational Camp in Florida, it has blossomed from hosting 163 players in its inaugural edition to over 300 expected this year -- the NFL said that 319 prospects were invited.

Representatives from all 32 NFL teams will be in attendance -- from front office staff and coaches to scouts.

It is held over four days from Thursday, March 2, to Sunday, March 5, with each position group getting their own dedicated portion to showcase their skill sets in front of the watching media and NFL teams.

Defensive linemen and linebackers begin proceedings on Thursday before defensive backs try their hand on Friday.

The weekend begins with arguably the most important day, with quarterbacks, wide receivers and tight ends displaying their talent Saturday before running backs and offensive lineman close out the combine on Sunday.

Not only will teams be able to watch players be put through their paces, but they will also have the opportunity to interview them in an effort to build out a more complete draft profile, including personality and psychological notes, before making a decision on whether they want to draft them.

Players will also be subjected to medical examinations to allow teams to avoid injury complications down the line.

A full test

The tests the prospects will be put through are aimed at challenging their repertoire of physical capabilities to help teams evaluate the whole package.

The most notable event is the 40-yard dash which sees prospects sprint the distance to display their top speed.

John Ross set the record with the fastest 40-yard time in 2017, running 4.22 seconds. Last year, it looked like Ross' record might have been broken when Baylor's Tyquan Thornton ran an unofficial time of 4.21 seconds -- it was later made official with a time of 4.28 seconds.

Ross runs the 40-yard dash in a record time of 4.22 seconds in 2017.

Thornton's Baylor teammate, Kalon Barnes, was just slower with a time of 4.23 seconds. UTSA's Tariq Woolen, who would go on to be voted to the Pro Bowl after his first season with the Seattle Seahawks, ran 4.26 seconds.

It's unlikely Ross' record will be broken, but there are some serious speedsters taking to the running track in Indianapolis who could threaten him.

Other physical drills include a bench press -- where players bench press 225 pounds as many times as possible -- a vertical jump and a broad jump.

The final drills -- the three-cone drill, 20-yard shuttle and the 60-yard shuttle -- are all designed to test an athlete's quickness and agility, as they must rush between various points before making short and sharp turns of direction before sprinting in opposite directions.

All in all, it is described on the official NFL website as the ""ultimate four-day job interview"" with it holding the possibility of catapulting up the draft list or severely hampering one's stock.

The Chicago Bears currently hold the No. 1 overall pick in April's draft, with the Houston Texans second and the Arizona Cardinals in third.

Balling out

The biggest names in college football have been invited to the combine this year, with teams and fans alike thrilled at the opportunity to watch them strut their stuff.

The quarterbacks which are expected to be selected near the top of the draft -- Bryce Young, CJ Stroud, Will Levis and Anthony Richardson -- will be in attendance, although Alabama star Young has reportedly chosen not to thrown, instead choosing to wait for his school's specific pro-day later in the month.

Young celebrates after receiving the Sugar Bowl MVP award on December 31, 2022.

Many of the other prospects predicted to go near the top of the draft will be in attendance too.

Alabama edge rusher Will Anderson Jr., Texas running back Bijan Robinson, Illinois corner back Devon Witherspoon, Northwestern offensive tackle Peter Skoronski, Texas Tech edge rusher Tyree Wilson, Georgia Tech edge rusher Keion White, Utah tight end Dalton Kincaid and USC wide receiver Jordan Addison are just some of the names on the list.

Witherspoon celebrates after the Illinois Fighting Illini beat the Chattanooga Mocs on September 22, 2022.

One of the players who was scheduled to work out but will not now is University of Georgia standout Jalen Carter after he surrendered to police in Athens, Georgia, on Wednesday night on charges related to a crash that killed his teammate and a team staffer hours after they celebrated the Bulldogs' national championship victory.

Carter -- who has been projected as a top pick in the NFL draft next month -- turned himself in at the Athens-Clarke County Jail on charges of reckless driving and racing, jail records show. He was booked at 11:33 p.m. and released a short time later at 11:49 p.m.

Carter's teammate Devin Willock and football team staff member Chandler LeCroy were killed in the January 15 crash, which happened hours after the team participated in a parade through the UGA campus to celebrate its second consecutive national title.

LeCroy was driving a Ford SUV near the campus with Willock and two other members of the football program also in the vehicle, police have said.

64,64,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/02/sport/brian-flores-judge-lawsuit-nfl-spt-intl,"Brian Flores' racial discrimination lawsuit against NFL and multiple teams can proceed, judge says","(CNN) Former Miami Dolphins head coach and current Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores' lawsuit against the NFL and three teams -- the Denver Broncos, the New York Giants and the Houston Texans -- can proceed instead of going to arbitration, a federal judge said on Wednesday.

Judge Valerie Caproni issued the decision, allowing Flores to pursue his case against the three teams and the NFL through a court, though his suit against the Miami Dolphins and both Steve Wilks' and Ray Horton's cases will go through arbitration.

""This case shines an unflattering spotlight on the employment practices of National Football League (""NFL"") teams. Although the clear majority of professional football players are Black, only a tiny percentage of coaches are Black,"" Caproni wrote in her decision.

Flores' attorney Doug Wigdor said in a statement: ""We are pleased that Coach Flores' class claims of systematic discrimination against the NFL and several teams will proceed in court and ultimately before a jury of his peers.""

Last year, Flores, who had recently been fired by the Miami Dolphins after three seasons as head coach, filed a federal civil lawsuit, alleging racial discrimination in the hiring practices for head coaching jobs.

Flores alleged in the suit that Dolphins' owner Stephen Ross offered to pay him to purposely lose games in order to secure a higher pick in the NFL draft and encouraged him to purposely violate league tampering rules.

When he refused, Ross then led a campaign to treat Flores with ""disdain and held out as someone who was noncompliant and difficult to work with,"" the lawsuit states.

The Dolphins didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment, though when Flores initiated his lawsuit just over a year ago the NFL team said: ""We vehemently deny any allegations of racial discrimination and are proud of the diversity and inclusion throughout our organization.""

""The implication that we acted in a manner inconsistent with the integrity of the game is incorrect.""

Flores also accused the Giants and Broncos of carrying out sham interviews in order to comply with the ""Rooney Rule,"" which requires teams to interview at least two minority candidates for open head coaching jobs.

Last month he was hired by the Minnesota Vikings as a defensive coordinator after spending last season as senior defensive assistant/linebackers coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers, which was noted by the Judge Caproni.

In her ruling, she also noted the league's ""long history of systematic discrimination toward Black players, coaches, and managers -- are incredibly troubling.""

""Given the number of Black men who play and coach football, it is difficult to understand how it could be that, at the time Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit, 'the NFL had only one Black Head Coach.'""

The Giants declined to comment, while CNN Sport has reached out to the Broncos and Texans for comment.

NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy said in a statement to CNN: ""Diversity and inclusion throughout the NFL make us a better organization. We recognize there is more work to be done and we are deeply committed to doing it.

""That said, we are pleased with the court's decision, which correctly holds that the vast majority of claims in this case are properly arbitrable by the Commissioner under binding agreements signed by each plaintiff.

""We intend to move forward promptly with arbitrations as directed by the court and will seek to dismiss the remaining claims.""

67,67,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/02/golf/pga-tour-designated-events-liv-golf-spt-intl,"Rory McIlroy backs revamped PGA Tour schedule, as LIV Golf hits back","(CNN) Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson didn't go head-to-head enough during their heyday, according to one leading US golfer on Wednesday.

If the PGA Tour's revamped 2024 schedule succeeds in pitting the golf's major stars against one another more regularly, the sport's latest rivalries could be about to get more showings.

The new schedule offers increased prize purses, smaller fields, and no cuts, much like the breakaway LIV Golf Series

""It is more opportunity for the top players to battle it out late on Sundays,"" world No. 8 Max Homa told reporters.

""Which, you look back at times of Phil and Tiger, the two best players growing up for me watching, and they had like maybe two real battles. So we're going to have more of that.""

World No. 3 Rory McIlroy is another supporter of the revamp, describing as it as ""trying to get the top guys vs. the hot guys.""

Unveiled by PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan in a letter to the Tour's membership, the new schedule will include eight ""designated events"" made up of between 70 and 78 players.

Eligibility criteria, as well as which events are to be marked as ""designated,"" are set to be specified at a later date, a press release from the Tour said.

However, it added that the ""framework"" for eligibility will ""reward top performers"" on the Tour -- including the top 50 players from the previous year's FedEx Cup rankings, the top-30 PGA Tour players in the world rankings, and tournament winners during the season.

And with no 36-hole cut line, all golfers competing will play the entirety of the events that offer elevated purses, as well as FedEx Cup points.

Though involvement will not be mandatory, these two factors, as well as the competitiveness and ""prestige"" of the tournaments, will ""incentivize"" participation, the Tour added.

""These smaller, Designated event fields will not only deliver substantial, can't-miss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season, but they will also enhance the quality of Full-Field events,"" Monahan said in the letter to players.

""Together, this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive, compelling, consequential and with clarity for fans, players and sponsors alike.""

The new scheduling will not affect the majors, The Players Championship, as well as three FedEx Cup Playoff events. Their existing format is set to remain unchanged, with designated events run in addition.

'Imitation is the greatest form of flattery'

Designated events were first announced by the PGA Tour last August, with 12 on the 2023 schedule. The first on this season's calendar was the Phoenix Open in February, as Scottie Scheffler secured $3.6 million in prize money.

Though still including a cut line, the increased purses at these tournaments were offered as a response to the emergence of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Series last year.

Bankrolled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), LIV Golf offered huge amounts of money for players to leave the established tours -- the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour -- to join the new series.

PIF pledged to award $250 million in total prize money for the tour's inaugural season. Of the $25 million prizes purses offered at each of the first seven events, $20 million was a guaranteed split between players. Played across three rounds as opposed to the typical four, golfers could not be cut as part of a team-based format.

""Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Congratulations PGA Tour. Welcome to the future,"" read a tweet from LIV Golf's official account Wednesday.

The inaugural LIV Golf event was hosted at Centurion Club in St Albans, England in June 2022.

Ahead of the PGA Tour's Arnold Palmer Invitational this week, a host of its big-name golfers were quizzed on their views about the revamped schedule.

Consistently outspoken against LIV Golf, accusing it of ""ripping apart"" men's professional golf, McIlroy has previously been dubbed the de-facto spokesperson for the PGA Tour.

Asked whether the new schedule's restricted eligibility criteria could leave lower-ranked golfers ""on the outside looking in,"" the four-time major champion said he was firmly behind the new plans.

""I love it,"" McIlroy told reporters Wednesday. ""Obviously I've been a part of it and been in a ton of discussions. I think it makes the TOUR more competitive.

""I'm all about rewarding good play. I want to give everyone a fair shake at this. Which I think this structure has done. There's ways to play into it.

When Scheffler was asked whether designated events were threatening to create a ""closed shop,"" the world No. 2 said: ""I think it's exciting because you're going to have the top guys in the world playing against each other more often.

""You're going to be able to guarantee the sponsors that those guys are going to be there four days. I think that's a lot of value added to TV and for sponsors.

""I think it's a better model overall for the Tour to have a set of events that are aspirational and that give guys access to those events.

""If you earn your way in to those events, the top 50 in the FedExCup this year gets into all of 'em ... I think it's more of a reward for the guys that are playing the best on the Tour.""

McIlroy discussed his thoughts on the new schedule on Wednesday.

Scheffler: Money not a factor

Discussing the increased spotlight on prize purses, Scheffler insisted that money was not a ""motivating factor"" for players on the PGA Tour.

""We get paid a ridiculous amount of money to do what we do out here, but I don't think money is the motivating factor for too many guys,"" Scheffler said.

""You can't really base life decisions when it comes to money. When you're out here playing golf tournaments you're never thinking about the money, you just want to win the tournament.

""So as being kind of a golf purist, that's the motivation. I want to be able to play well, win tournaments and get the most out of my game.""

In response to the absence of a cut line at designated events, McIlroy highlighted the absence of cuts at various existing PGA Tour events -- including the CJ Cup and the Zozo Championship -- as proof there is a ""precedent"" for the format.

""The only reason no-cut events are a big deal is because LIV has come along ... There's been no-cut events since I've been a member of the TOUR and way beyond that as well,"" McIlroy said.

""It keeps the stars there for four days. You ask Mastercard or whoever it is to pay 20 million dollars for a golf event, they want to see the stars at the weekend. They want a guarantee that the stars are there. So if that's what needs to happen, then that's what happens.""

Homa's 'rant'

Perhaps the most impassioned defense of the new scheduling however, came from Homa, who warned he could ""rant on this for awhile"" regarding the changes as the 32-year-old American delivered a four four-minute monologue.

While he understood ""gripes"" around the limited fields, Homa said that discussions with Monahan had confirmed his belief that the plans were positive for the game.

""I think it's easy to frame these changes as a way to put more money in the top players' pockets, but it has been made to make it easier and more fun for the fans,"" said Homa.

Addressing concerns over restricted fields, Homa highlighted the example of an unnamed golfer who had become a ""running joke"" due to his participation in a PGA Tour event. According to Homa, the player was a professional golfer but was no longer a practicing pro.

""Those people will be in a ton of the events,"" he said.

Homa in action during the pro-am prior to the Arnold Palmer Invitational.

""Now the sponsors have to say, 'Well do we want ... a chunk of the field [being] guys that won an event years and years ago that have jobs or have retired well before that,"" added Homa.

""It is a major in a way or a major field every single week.

""So I think it will be a new and improved challenge. I think it's important that we all test each other against one another each week. If you don't, you will get pushed aside and have to work your way back up.

""It will be a different kind of stress that we haven't had before, but I do think it will be stressful.""

Asked if he wanted a break before continuing with the rest of his press conference, Homa declined, quipping: ""Sorry guys. I think a lot and you just heard my brain spill out.""",['Jack Bantock'],2023-03-02,"tiger woods and phil mickelson didn't go head-to-head enough during their heyday, according to one leading us golfer on wednesday.if the pga tour's revamped 2024 schedule succeeds in pitting the golf's major stars against one another more regularly, the sport's latest rivalries could be about to get more showings.the new schedule offers increased prize purses, smaller fields, and no cuts, much like the breakaway liv golf series""it is more opportunity for the top players to battle it out late on sundays,"" world no. 8 max homa told reporters.""which, you look back at times of phil and tiger, the two best players growing up for me watching, and they had like maybe two real battles. so we're going to have more of that.""world no. 3 rory mcilroy is another supporter of the revamp, describing as it as ""trying to get the top guys vs. the hot guys.""unveiled by pga tour commissioner jay monahan in a letter to the tour's membership, the new schedule will include eight ""designated events"" made up of between 70 and 78 players.eligibility criteria, as well as which events are to be marked as ""designated,"" are set to be specified at a later date, a press release from the tour said.however, it added that the ""framework"" for eligibility will ""reward top performers"" on the tour -- including the top 50 players from the previous year's fedex cup rankings, the top-30 pga tour players in the world rankings, and tournament winners during the season.and with no 36-hole cut line, all golfers competing will play the entirety of the events that offer elevated purses, as well as fedex cup points.though involvement will not be mandatory, these two factors, as well as the competitiveness and ""prestige"" of the tournaments, will ""incentivize"" participation, the tour added.""these smaller, designated event fields will not only deliver substantial, can't-miss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season, but they will also enhance the quality of full-field events,"" monahan said in the letter to players.""together, this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive, compelling, consequential and with clarity for fans, players and sponsors alike.""the new scheduling will not affect the majors, the players championship, as well as three fedex cup playoff events. their existing format is set to remain unchanged, with designated events run in addition.'imitation is the greatest form of flattery'designated events were first announced by the pga tour last august, with 12 on the 2023 schedule. the first on this season's calendar was the phoenix open in february, as scottie scheffler secured $3.6 million in prize money.though still including a cut line, the increased purses at these tournaments were offered as a response to the emergence of the saudi-backed liv golf series last year.bankrolled by saudi arabia's public investment fund (pif), liv golf offered huge amounts of money for players to leave the established tours -- the pga tour and the dp world tour -- to join the new series.pif pledged to award $250 million in total prize money for the tour's inaugural season. of the $25 million prizes purses offered at each of the first seven events, $20 million was a guaranteed split between players. played across three rounds as opposed to the typical four, golfers could not be cut as part of a team-based format.""imitation is the greatest form of flattery. congratulations pga tour. welcome to the future,"" read a tweet from liv golf's official account wednesday.the inaugural liv golf event was hosted at centurion club in st albans, england in june 2022.ahead of the pga tour's arnold palmer invitational this week, a host of its big-name golfers were quizzed on their views about the revamped schedule.consistently outspoken against liv golf, accusing it of ""ripping apart"" men's professional golf, mcilroy has previously been dubbed the de-facto spokesperson for the pga tour.asked whether the new schedule's restricted eligibility criteria could leave lower-ranked golfers ""on the outside looking in,"" the four-time major champion said he was firmly behind the new plans.""i love it,"" mcilroy told reporters wednesday.

Completing a dramatic late charge to clinch the 150th Open Championship at the legendary St. Andrews Old Course, the Australian could not have wished for a more magical way to secure his first major title.

And yet, celebrations in Scotland were nothing compared to those in Brisbane four months later. A home city victory at the Australian PGA Championship in November put the cherry on top of the delicious cake that was 2022 for Smith.

""That left a really good taste in the mouth for the end of the year,"" the 29-year-old told CNN. ""There was a few more people there and I think it was kind of a celebration of the year as well.

79,79,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/02/motorsport/fernando-alonso-formula-one-aston-martin-spt-intl,Fernando Alonso still hungry for success after joining 'ambitious' Aston Martin,"(CNN) More than 20 years after his Formula One debut, Fernando Alonso is as hungry as ever ahead of the start of the 2023 season, which gets underway on Friday at the Bahrain Grand Prix.

That desire for success led him to make the seismic decision last year to reject a new contract with Alpine to join Aston Martin, he tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies.

""It has to be an ambitious project. It has to be a project that wants to win, a project that will take anything and will do everything to make it happen. And that is what I feel in Aston Martin,"" the Spaniard said ahead of the season's start.

""There is this talent and this hunger for success, success and success.""

Success certainly comes naturally to the 41-year-old Spaniard. Having exploded onto the F1 scene in 2001, he won his first race in 2003 before winning back-to-back championships in 2005 and 2006, becoming the youngest double champion in the sport's history.

Since then, the winner of 32 races has had legendary battles with some of the best drivers of the last two decades, from Michael Schumacher and Kimi Räikkönen through to Lewis Hamilton and Sebastien Vettel, who Alonso has replaced at Aston Martin after the four-time champion retired from F1.

Aston Martin is Alonso's fifth team and the first move he has made since he returned to F1 with Alpine in 2021.

The frustration of the 2010s led to the Spaniard calling quits on his F1 career in 2018, retiring after five years without a race win and seemingly disillusioned with the sport.

He competed in the IndyCar Series, Le Mans' 24-hour race and the Dakar Rally, where he emerged unscathed from a crash in which his Toyota Hilux flew through the air after hitting a sand dune in Saudi Arabia.

Alonso won his first drivers' Championship in 2005 before retaining the title in 2006.

Three years later he made his sensational return to F1, but failed to hit the heights of his early career.

After finishing 10th in 2021 and ninth in 2022 with Alpine, Alonso turned down a one-year contract extension to join an Aston Martin team on its way up.

""The investment is there, the new facilities, new wind tunnel coming out. New people, joining the team from different experiences and different backgrounds,"" he says of Aston Martin's ""wonderful project.""

The investment is certainly there. Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin's boss and the father of Alonso's new partner, Lance, has put the money where his mouth is.

The team launched its new $200 million factory at Silverstone and broke the bank to bring in the best engineers and talent from other teams to support its new star driver.

With the new investment and Alonso's terrific performance at pre-season testing -- where he came second on the first day of testing in Bahrain -- Aston Martin looks set to become the best of the rest this season, behind usual title contenders Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes.

2023 season set for more controversies

The 2023 season is set to be the biggest yet, but it has got off to a rocky start after drivers complained about new rules introduced by governing body the FIA, restricting them from making ""political, religious and personal statements"" unless previously approved in writing.

The FIA has since responded by clarifying that drivers will be able to ""express their views on any political, religious or personal matter"" outside of races, but during races and on the track, any displays must be pre-approved by the governing body or the drivers will face sanctions.

The 2023 season is also set to be the busiest on record, with 23 races over nine months -- a decision that some drivers have opposed.

Current back-to-back champion Max Verstappen expressed his discontent with the calendar, previously telling CNN Sport: ""The problem is that we are traveling so much and it's getting more and more ... Basically, the question is, is it worth it to spend so much time away from family and friends by chasing more success?""

Alonso is hoping to compete with the top table of F1.

When asked if drivers have enough say in the future of the sport, Alonso thinks ""probably not.""

""But this is maybe not our role on this sport,"" he added. ""We drive these cars in on Sunday afternoons, but we cannot forget that this is a team sport.

""I think we have the right people leading the sport. We are in good hands with Liberty [Media], with Stefano Domenicali, with the FIA as well. I think we should put trust in our leaders.""

While Alonso admits that it will be ""challenging,"" he strikes a far more positive tone than many of his fellow drivers.

""I think it's going to be demanding on teams, mechanics, media, all of us,"" he said. ""But we love what we do. We have a dream job. We enjoy every second of it.""

Alonso unquestionably loves what he does. Last season, he overtook Kimi Räikkönen to become the first driver in F1 history to start 350 races, and doesn't look like stopping anytime soon.

He is coy on Aston Martin's chances of challenging this season, saying that a podium finish is not a ""realistic target at the moment,"" but if the pre-season omens are anything to go by, that target could rapidly become more reality than fantasy.

Two decades on from his first race win, Alonso looks like he might just be a contender once again.","['Amanda Davies', 'Alasdair Howorth']",2023-03-02,"more than 20 years after his formula one debut, fernando alonso is as hungry as ever ahead of the start of the 2023 season, which gets underway on friday at the bahrain grand prix.that desire for success led him to make the seismic decision last year to reject a new contract with alpine to join aston martin, he tells cnn sport's amanda davies.""it has to be an ambitious project. it has to be a project that wants to win, a project that will take anything and will do everything to make it happen. and that is what i feel in aston martin,"" the spaniard said ahead of the season's start.""there is this talent and this hunger for success, success and success.""success certainly comes naturally to the 41-year-old spaniard. having exploded onto the f1 scene in 2001, he won his first race in 2003 before winning back-to-back championships in 2005 and 2006, becoming the youngest double champion in the sport's history.since then, the winner of 32 races has had legendary battles with some of the best drivers of the last two decades, from michael schumacher and kimi rikknen through to lewis hamilton and sebastien vettel, who alonso has replaced at aston martin after the four-time champion retired from f1.aston martin is alonso's fifth team and the first move he has made since he returned to f1 with alpine in 2021.the frustration of the 2010s led to the spaniard calling quits on his f1 career in 2018, retiring after five years without a race win and seemingly disillusioned with the sport.he competed in the indycar series, le mans' 24-hour race and the dakar rally, where he emerged unscathed from a crash in which his toyota hilux flew through the air after hitting a sand dune in saudi arabia.alonso won his first drivers' championship in 2005 before retaining the title in 2006.three years later he made his sensational return to f1, but failed to hit the heights of his early career.after finishing 10th in 2021 and ninth in 2022 with alpine, alonso turned down a one-year contract extension to join an aston martin team on its way up.""the investment is there, the new facilities, new wind tunnel coming out. new people, joining the team from different experiences and different backgrounds,"" he says of aston martin's ""wonderful project.""the investment is certainly there. lawrence stroll, aston martin's boss and the father of alonso's new partner, lance, has put the money where his mouth is.the team launched its new $200 million factory at silverstone and broke the bank to bring in the best engineers and talent from other teams to support its new star driver.with the new investment and alonso's terrific performance at pre-season testing -- where he came second on the first day of testing in bahrain -- aston martin looks set to become the best of the rest this season, behind usual title contenders red bull, ferrari and mercedes.2023 season set for more controversiesthe 2023 season is set to be the biggest yet, but it has got off to a rocky start after drivers complained about new rules introduced by governing body the fia, restricting them from making ""political, religious and personal statements"" unless previously approved in writing.the fia has since responded by clarifying that drivers will be able to ""express their views on any political, religious or personal matter"" outside of races, but during races and on the track, any displays must be pre-approved by the governing body or the drivers will face sanctions.the 2023 season is also set to be the busiest on record, with 23 races over nine months -- a decision that some drivers have opposed.current back-to-back champion max verstappen expressed his discontent with the calendar, previously telling cnn sport: ""the problem is that we are traveling so much and it's getting more and more ... basically, the question is, is it worth it to spend so much time away from family and friends by chasing more success?""alonso is hoping to compete with the top table of f1.when asked if drivers have enough say in the future of the sport, alonso thinks ""probably not.""""but this is maybe not our role on this sport,"" he added.

91,91,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/06/football/world-cup-final-penalty-shootout-spt-intl,World Cup final: How Argentina won penalty shootout,"(CNN) A soccer match lasts for 90 minutes, another 30 if there really needs to be a winner. But if it's still level after that, then the game will be decided with a penalty shootout , arguably the most nerve-shredding experience in all of sports.

For the fans, it's excruciating; at the World Cup in Qatar , one Argentina supporter sobbed uncontrollably as she watched the quarterfinal shootout against the Netherlands through her fingers. By the end, she looked distraught. All the emotion had been wrung out of her, and the tears that she cried were of relief, rather than joy.

For the players, such emotions are magnified tenfold. ""Love hurts,"" goes the anonymous quote, ""but not as much as penalties.""

Success or failure could be career-defining, one simple kick from 12 yards is weighed down by teammates' hopes and the expectation of potentially millions of fans. As the author Karl Wiggins put it, ""It's as if, for a few seconds, a player's soul is laid bare for the entire world to see.""

Very few people would admit to enjoying a shootout, but Professor Geir Jordet is an exception; he can't get enough of them.

""A penalty shootout is a very uncomfortable event,"" he told CNN Sport from his research facility in Oslo. ""It's painful because the pressure is so intense, and of course, the consequences of failing are so dire. Penalties, for me, are wonderful!""

Professor Jordet works at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, where he specializes in performance under extreme pressure. He's been studying shootouts for almost 20 years and has analyzed more than 200 of them, around 2,000 kicks in total.

He's studied the psychology of the event, observed the behavior and dynamics of the participants and crunched the data to conclude that even the most dramatic of shootouts can be swayed by teams who know what they're doing.

""The main factor in a penalty shootout is luck,"" the former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton once declared, but Jordet is convinced that it is never ""only a lottery.""

Penalties are more important than ever

The margin between success and failure in title matches seems to be getting slimmer, and so it's in shootouts, where the margins are even tighter, that soccer's biggest prizes are being decided.

""If you enter a major tournament today with the ambition to win,"" says Jordet, ""you're making a severe mistake if you're not prepared for penalties.""

In 2021, both the Brazilian men and the Canadian women needed penalty wins en route to Olympic gold in Tokyo; in the same month, Argentina survived a shootout to win the Copa América and Italy triumphed in the same way at the European Championship at Wembley.

Mohamed Salah had to endure laser pointers in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations final penalty shootout.

The following year was a bonanza for penalties.

Starting in February with Senegal's Africa Cup of Nations final win against Egypt. Liverpool won two English cup finals -- both against Chelsea -- on spot-kicks, while Real Betis and RB Leipzig won the Spanish and German Cup finals respectively from the spot.

Eintracht Frankfurt beat Rangers in the Europa League final on penalties while the Philadelphia Union missed all of its kicks to hand LAFC the title after an extraordinary MLS Cup Final.

The 2022 penalty party concluded in Qatar where there was a record five shootouts, including the final.

Within seconds of the final whistle being blown, Jordet can tell if one side has the edge. He's able to glean valuable information simply by observing the interactions on the field.

""The coach and the staff of some teams almost panic when the game goes to penalties,"" Jordet explained to CNN Sport. ""It seems like they don't know what to do. And then with other teams, it's all dealt with before the game and definitely before the penalties.""

Jurgen Klopp won plaudits for the way he managed two penalty shootout victories for Liverpool in the League and FA Cup finals.

Last season's FA Cup final was a case in point; Jordet observed that Liverpool's manager Jurgen Klopp had established a plan and communicated it calmly and warmly to each of his players within 90 seconds of the final whistle.

They spent the remaining time casually interacting and even laughing. Several more minutes had passed before Chelsea's seemingly fraught manager Thomas Tuchel approached his players, and he was still revising his notes.

""He moves to the middle of the circle, BEFORE he's done with the plan,"" Jordet observed in a tweet thread, ""Tuchel then asks his players about the shots, publicly in front of the whole team.

""There's plenty of group pressure when done this way, the chance of honest responses from the players drops, and it creates further stress that carries on to the shootout itself.""

Liverpool's efficient organization meant the players were able to take up a position within the center circle that was closest to their coaching staff, where Klopp continued to exude warmth and love.

Chelsea went on to miss two penalties and Liverpool claimed the trophy.

World Cup Final penalty masterclass

Nobody can influence the proceedings in a shootout more than the goalkeeper, who is involved in every single kick. Jordet's research has confirmed that the goalies aren't just there to stop the shots, they can be a positive influence on their teammates and a destructive force for their opponents.

In recent seasons, Argentina's 30-year-old goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez has established himself as a gamechanger in shootouts, the ""Machiavelli of football.""

Jordet has noticed that his psychological antics are a nightmare for his opponents. During the semifinal of the Copa América against Colombia in 2021, he intimidated his opponents with trash talk, saving three penalties in a 3-2 win.

Since the stadiums were empty of fans in that edition, Jordet has noted that you could clearly hear what he was saying, ""I can tell you're nervous. I know where you're going to shoot. Watch and see how I'm going to eat you up. Remember, I'm going to eat you up!""

But it was in the World Cup final against France that Martínez demonstrated the full range of his expertise.

Jordet says that he set the tone right from the start, arriving first in the penalty area and claiming the territory as his own. ""Martínez took a very proactive approach to everything,"" Jordet explained.

""He created his home in the penalty area. He initiated some handshakes with the first French players to arrive,"" a disarming strategy which makes opponents drop their guard and renders them more vulnerable when he later strikes.

Argentina fans played their part by pilling pressure on the French penalty takers.

For the first two French penalties, Martínez discreetly set about disrupting the takers, urging the referee to check the placement of the ball on the spot.

This kind of interference would be unsettling for any penalty takers, but he was also feeling out the referee: how much would he be prepared to tolerate?

Jordet believes that enabled Martínez to quickly assume a proactive role within just two kicks and was then able to ""fully get to work.""

Martínez saved the second penalty that he faced, diving low to his right to deny Kingsley Coman, and his celebration was exuberant.

Jordet notes that goalkeepers don't typically celebrate so wildly, but his research has shown that celebrations can influence subsequent events.

""We found, to our astonishment, that penalty takers who celebrate intensely have a statistically higher probability of ending up on the winning team.

""In fact, the next penalty taker for the opponent misses about 10-15% of the time, and your next [teammate] scores about 7 to 8% more of their penalties. These types of celebratory displays are contagious.""

By the time the third French player stepped up, Martínez knew that he could get away with almost anything. He snatched up the ball, turned his back on the referee and walked back to his goal line.

The approaching Aurélien Tchouaméni should have arrived at the biggest moment of his professional career to find the ball on the spot, instead Martínez was holding it, gesturing to the Argentine fans to increase the volume.

France fans show their support for les bleus during the World Cup final.

When the referee demanded its return, Martínez rolled it away at a 45-degree angle, forcing Tchouaméni to fetch it himself. Jordet has calculated that whenever a player has to wait for a kick, the probability of a goal drops by 20 to 30%.

Tchouaméni aimed low and to the left and missed.

By now, Martínez knew that his own teammates could face similar tactics from the French goalie Hugo Lloris, so he grabbed the ball himself and handed it to his incoming teammate Leandro Paredes, one of four Argentine penalty takers, who all scored.

Martínez was eventually booked for interfering with the fourth French player, Randal Kolo Muani, but by then the damage was done and Argentina won the shootout 4-2.

""Very calculated, creative, well executed,"" Jordet concludes, ""but of course also highly, highly cynical.""

Emiliano Martínez of Argentina attempted to distract Randal Kolo Muani ahead of his penalty.

Martínez showed very little remorse for his ""cynical"" actions. After the final he said, """"I have no words for it. I was calm during the penalty shootout and everything went as we wanted.""

""All that I have dreamed of has been achieved.""

Since the conclusion of the World Cup, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which determines the laws of football, confirmed to CNN Sport that it is looking to clarify what goalkeepers can and cannot do before penalties are taken.

This would include delaying the taking of the kick or touching the goalposts, crossbar or goal net.

Shootouts don't always have to be so negative, though; sometimes, they can be won with love.

Jordet notes that when LAFC's Cristian Tello missed the first penalty against Philadelphia in the MLS Cup Final, some of his teammates met him on his return to the center circle and walked him back in.

""You're implicitly saying to the others that even if you miss, you're a part of the group, which is the message that you would like to send to each other in a penalty shootout.""

Los Angeles made every other kick to claim the cup.

The power of intangibles

Some teams seem to revel in the cauldron of the shootout, while others dread it.

England has lost seven of the 10 that it's participated in, while the Netherlands have lost seven out of eight. Spain's loss to Morocco in 2022 means it's now lost a record four shootouts in the FIFA World Cup alone.

Jordet has seen enough to believe in ghosts; he says that if your team has lost in a previous shootout, even if you weren't involved in it, you're more likely to miss. Conversely, success begets success.

Having lost to Czechoslovakia and the famous Antonin Panenka penalty i n the European Championship final in 1976, Germany has won six in a row, Croatia has won its last four, and Argentina its last three, claiming both the Copa América and the World Cup.

More and more teams are coming to accept that understanding the psychology of shootouts is essential in the modern game, and 20 professional teams have already turned to Jordet's consultancy business for help.

""I totally think there's so much more to be discovered in the softer areas of sports science,"" Jordet says, dismissing the cynics who claim that skill development, relationships and psychology are important, but not quantifiable.

""I honestly would beg to differ. If you know what to look for, you can measure a lot of these things in games, and this is something I work on every single day. I think we will make some big progress in the years to come.""

The Moroccan team gathered together for a prayer before going on to beat Spain in their penalty shootout.

Jordet knows so much about penalties because he spent years trawling the archives, watching every single shootout from the World Cup, European Championship and Copa América since 1976. He's interviewed 25 players who were there and tested his predictions in practice with 15 elite teams.

""I love penalty shootouts,"" he says, ""I think it's the ultimate drama in football.""

And yet, much of the nuance he described in the World Cup final wouldn't have been obvious to the fans watching the game on TV because broadcasters tend to fill the space between the kicks with replays and closeups of anxious coaches and fans.

""The details that really mattered, the subplot of the event, can only be accessed if you're lucky enough to have access to isolated broadcast cameras or by scrolling through fan videos on YouTube.

""TV producers aren't always my friends,"" Jordet concludes, ""because they don't look at what I like to look at.""

But now that teams are beginning to realize the value of small details in shootouts, perhaps broadcasters might also consider innovating their approach.

92,92,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/07/sport/conor-benn-doping-analysis-reaction-spt-intl,Conor Benn has 'serious concerns' over boxing's drug testing after being cleared of failed test because of 'highly-elevated consumption of eggs',"(CNN) Conor Benn's scheduled fight with Chris Eubank Jr. last year was meant to be career defining for both men.

Except the fight never took place and now Benn says the fallout of its cancellation has raised serious questions about boxing's drugs testing protocols.

The two were scheduled to take to their ring almost exactly 30 years after their fathers had in two fights that gripped a generation of boxing fans. Benn and Eubank Jr. were fighting for more than just glory. This was a fight for family honor.

But on the eve of the bout, news of Benn failing a drugs test came to light. The bout was called off after Benn tested positive for clomiphene, a fertility drug used by women who struggle to ovulate.

Benn repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and in February 2023, the World Boxing Council (WBC) issued a statement clearing Benn of wrongdoing, stating that while his urine test indicated the presence of prohibited substances, his ""highly-elevated consumption of eggs"" prior to testing offered a ""reasonable explanation"" for his failed test.

Despite welcoming the news that he could return to the sport, the 26-year-old Benn has criticized the investigation and expressed his concerns about the transparency of the process, in particular leveling criticism at the WBC and the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC), the governing body for professional boxing in Great Britain.

In a statement posted on his Instagram story last week, Benn said that ""the manner in which I've been cleared has seemed to create further questions and add further fuel to baseless negative speculation.""

CNN has contacted the WBC and BBBofC for comment.

Cancellation

According to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), clomiphene in men can potentially boost testosterone levels ""by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis."" The drug is also included on the World Anti-Doping Agency's prohibited list under anti-estrogenic substances.

Benn began his statement on Instagram addressing the ruling saying that while he was ""grateful for the ultimate finding"" of being declared ""innocent of being a drugs cheat,"" he couldn't sit by without commenting on the whole investigation.

""It was the right decision and it was the only one I was willing to accept. The easy option would have been to accept a six month ban, save myself a huge legal bill and simply move on, by my reputation and my family name is worth more to me than that,"" he wrote.

""At no point did I indicate that I failed any VADA tests because of contaminated eggs,"" Benn wrote, referring to the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA), a third-party testing agency used by the fighters to ensure a clean bout and which carried out his test.

""As part of its lengthy investigation, the WBC instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet, and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause,"" he wrote, saying he provided a 270-page report to the body.

Benn added: ""However, I feel like the WBC statement did a disservice to my defence, which was based upon a comprehensive scientific review of the testing procedures which set out a number of reasons why we believed the results were completely unreliable and proved beyond any reasonable doubt that I am innocent.""

Benn is still under investigation from UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) and the BBCofC at the time of publication.

He criticized the BBCofC's handling of his case in his statement.

""As for the BBBoC, they attacked me publicly and privately during the most difficult time in my life, treating me with utter contempt and without any consideration for the fair process or my mental state.""

The BBCofC released their own statement on Twitter after the announcement from the WBC in February, saying that it was not ""party to the review"" and had not seen ""any evidence provided on Mr. Benn's behalf.""

It added that while ""it respects the WBC, the WBC is a sanctioning body and not a governing body. The BBCofC was the governing body with whom Mr. Benn was licensed at the material time, and as such any alleged anti-doping violation shall be dealt with in accordance with its rules and regulations.""

It pointed to the UK Anti-Doping Rules, brought in by UKAD, which the BBCofC adheres to and that as a result, ""the decision of the WBC does not affect the ongoing implantation of the BBCofC's rules (and those of UKAD).""

CNN has contacted the BBCofC for comment. UKAD declined to comment when given the opportunity.

'Serious concerns'

The WBC's February ruling stated that they had found there to be ""no failures in the procedures"" in relation to Benn's sample and test.

But Benn said he thought there was a lack of transparency throughout the whole investigation, claiming that his sample tested negative three times, but ""without explanation"" was tested nine days later which resulted in the positive test.

According to Benn, he asked for his B sample from the drug test -- which the World Anti-Doping Agency says ""affords the athlete the opportunity to have second analysis performed in the event their A sample returns"" a positive test -- to be tested as soon as possible.

Benn also said in his statement that he has been advised to take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Benn said that he had never previously tested positive for a banned substance before October's test, adding to his belief that the result was a ""testing error.""

While Benn now says that he had to concentrate on ""rebuilding"" his career, the process he has gone through has given him ""serious concerns about the whole testing system"" in boxing.

""Anti-doping protections are obviously extremely important, but so is ensuring people are given due proves and presumed innocent until proven guilty. Cheaters should be caught and punished, but people like me who prove their innocent should be vindicated and allowed to continue their career.""

Benn admitted that he'd had suicidal thoughts as a result of the whole process, saying: ""I didn't think I'd see another day.""

""It's hurt me,"" Benn said in an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. ""I didn't think I was going to make it through this period. I didn't think I was going to make it through.""

When asked if he had felt suicidal, Benn replied: ""Yeah. Yeah, I'd say so -- and it upsets me now because I don't know how I got so bad. I got in a really bad way about it.

""I was shamed for something I hadn't even done. ... If I had done something wrong, I'm human. I'd raise my hands to it, 'I made a mistake,' whatever it is, I raise my hands. Never this.

""I felt seven years of hard work and sacrifice, and leaving my family and the image I maintain, was just ruined by somebody else's incompetence. It's been hard for the family.""

Background

At the time of Benn's positive test last year, the bout's promoter, Matchroom, and that organization's boss, Eddie Hearn, had been keen for the bout to go ahead despite it being ""prohibited"" by the BBBofC.

Hearn told the BBC at the time: ""As we stand right now, the BBBofC is not sanctioning the fight. That does not mean the fight is off, but there is a process we have to go through.

""Conor Benn is not suspended, he is free and clear to fight. There's lots going on with the lawyers.""

Eddie Hearn, boxing promoter of Matchroom boxing, speaks at the press conference ahead of Benn's scheduled fight with Eubank Jr.

Amid mounting public pressure and safety concerns, the fight was canceled.

The decision to overlook potential safety concerns and stage a bout including a fighter who had tested positive for a banned substance prompted criticism that boxing prioritizes the fight's money-making opportunities rather than the boxers' safety.

Weeks later, the BBBofC claimed that Benn voluntarily relinquished his license with the governing body just before allegations of misconduct against Benn were upheld.

Benn accused the BBBofC of conducting an ""unfair and biased procedure."" He also disputes that he relinquished his license.

""(Benn) strongly refutes the allegation of misconduct (which for the avoidance of doubt is not in relation to the Vada issue) and firmly believes that an independent tribunal will reach a wholly different conclusion,"" a statement said on Benn's Twitter at the time.

And a few months later, the WBC announced after it had conducted an investigation into the matter that Benn would be included in its ratings once again after it found that he had not ""engaged in intentional or knowing ingestion of clomiphene.""",['Ben Morse'],2023-03-07,"conor benn's scheduled fight with chris eubank jr. last year was meant to be career defining for both men.except the fight never took place and now benn says the fallout of its cancellation has raised serious questions about boxing's drugs testing protocols.the two were scheduled to take to their ring almost exactly 30 years after their fathers had in two fights that gripped a generation of boxing fans. benn and eubank jr. were fighting for more than just glory. this was a fight for family honor.but on the eve of the bout, news of benn failing a drugs test came to light. the bout was called off after benn tested positive for clomiphene, a fertility drug used by women who struggle to ovulate.benn repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and in february 2023, the world boxing council (wbc) issued a statement clearing benn of wrongdoing, stating that while his urine test indicated the presence of prohibited substances, his ""highly-elevated consumption of eggs"" prior to testing offered a ""reasonable explanation"" for his failed test.despite welcoming the news that he could return to the sport, the 26-year-old benn has criticized the investigation and expressed his concerns about the transparency of the process, in particular leveling criticism at the wbc and the british boxing board of control (bbbofc), the governing body for professional boxing in great britain.in a statement posted on his instagram story last week, benn said that ""the manner in which i've been cleared has seemed to

being declared ""innocent of being a drugs cheat,"" he couldn't sit by without commenting on the whole investigation.""it was the right decision and it was the only one i was willing to accept. the easy option would have been to accept a six month ban, save myself a huge legal bill and simply move on, by my reputation and my family name is worth more to me than that,"" he wrote.""at no point did i indicate that i failed any vada tests because of contaminated eggs,"" benn wrote, referring to the voluntary anti-doping association (vada), a third-party testing agency used by the fighters to ensure a clean bout and which carried out his test.""as part of its lengthy investigation, the wbc instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet, and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause,"" he wrote, saying he provided a 270-page report to the body.benn added: ""however, i feel like the wbc statement did a disservice to my defence, which was based upon a comprehensive scientific review of the testing procedures which set out a number of reasons why we believed the results were completely unreliable and proved beyond any reasonable doubt

-- which the world anti-doping agency says ""affords the athlete the opportunity to have second analysis performed in the event their a sample returns"" a positive test -- to be tested as soon as possible.benn also said in his statement that he has been advised to take his case to the court of arbitration for sport.benn said that he had never previously tested positive for a banned substance

94,94,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/08/sport/cuba-womens-boxing-olympics-spt-intl,Cuban women boxers say they have had to endure sexist jabs. Now they're punching back,"(CNN) Even before they could climb into the ring, Cuba's female boxers had to roll with the punches.

While the island has long been famed for its top-level male boxers , women were blocked by an official prohibition on their practicing the sport competitively.

Cuba's government-run INDER sports institute claimed the sport was too violent for women, even as Cuban female athletes competed successfully in judo, karate and taekwondo.

For many hopeful women boxers on the island, the ban smacked of sexism -- and a missed opportunity.

""From the time we were in our mother's wombs we are fighters,"" long-time boxer and trainer Namibia Flores Rodríguez told CNN.

""We are always fighting for something, to raise our kids, to help our families, to be independent.""

Cuban women were previously limited to training in isolation and with no hope of competing in the sport.

Flores says she trained for years as many women interested in boxing do in Cuba: on her own dime and in gyms lacking in even the most basic equipment.

While they could learn and practice the sport as a hobby, the ban on women's boxing meant Cuban female athletes could not take part in tournaments on the island or abroad.

At least officially, women's boxing in Cuba did not exist.

A new dawn

In December, the first cracks in that glass ceiling appeared when officials made an about face after announcing that they had obtained the proper safety equipment for them -- such as padding and head gear.

""We took this step when we were sure, really convinced that it was the moment and we didn't have any concerns because our women would be protected,"" Cuban Boxing Commission President Alberto Puig de la Barca told reporters at a news conference.

The change, sports officials said at the news conference, was also the result of a newly implemented family code on the island that said women were required by law to have the same opportunities as men. That apparently included boxing.

Two weeks later, the first try outs were held at a cramped facility with a single boxing ring. Many of the women boxers had only recently switched from competing in martial arts or had merely dabbled in boxing.

Still, they sparred with passion, drawing appreciative cheering and applause from spectators.

After the first bout, an announcer exclaimed to the crowd of people watching, ""This is historic!""

Cuban boxer Namibia Flores has fought for years for women's boxing to be recognized in Cuba.

Boxer Legnis Cala Massó said she started boxing to learn self-defense and was still shocked to be putting on gloves to potentially represent her country.

""My first dream was to participate and that they would consider the women who were fighting in Cuba,"" she told CNN ahead of her bout. ""Now I want to be on the team.""

While Cuba's female boxers have a long way to go, officials are hopeful that their enthusiasm and natural ability can make up for lost time. Sports officials predicted that Cuban women boxers would compete in the Central American and Caribbean Games starting in June and the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.

The 39-year-old Flores has been a pioneer for Cuban women boxers.

Many female boxers said they had endured sexist jabs directed at them over the years, but novice fighter Melany de la Caridad Girado Bermudez told CNN she felt the perception of women taking part in the revered national sport was finally changing.

97,97,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/07/golf/brooks-koepka-funk-major-spt-spc-intl,"After 'a lot of down times' in 2022, Brooks Koepka is out of his 'funk' and chasing a fifth major","Or at least, what he imagines the feeling is like. The 32-year-old has no children of his own, but the four glistening trophies displayed in his home are equally cherished all the same.

The matching pairs of US Open and PGA Championships cups were all scooped in an unprecedented stretch between 2017 and 2019 that saw the American become the first golfer in history to win back-to-back titles in two different majors concurrently. Before Koepka, nobody had ever won their first four majors inside two years.

It means that, of the eight PGA Tour wins he has to his name, half are major triumphs. For Koepka, it's a ratio he is more than content with.

""Nothing quite feels the same, the majors are so different. It's the pinnacle of our sport, it's what you're judged by,"" Koepka told CNN.

""If you look at all the greats that have ever played this game, most people can't tell you how many PGA Tour events or how many European Tour events this person's won or that person's won, but they know exactly how many majors you've won.

""So, to me, that's what you're defined by.""

'I love it when athletes get cocky'

They are words that make for tough reading for the host of supremely talented golfers who never clinched, or are still chasing, a major win. With 11 runner-up finishes between them, Colin Montgomerie, Lee Westwood, and Rickie Fowler are just three acclaimed players for whom majors have proved elusive despite a plethora of professional wins.

Koepka has previously explained how majors are the easiest tournaments to win. It's a characteristic candidness that he makes no apologies for. In fact, he sees it as a strength.

""I'm pretty blunt, I don't like beating around the bush. I just say it how it is, I've always been that way,"" he said. ""I know my monotone can come off a little bit of a pain in the butt for people, but that's how I feel.

""I love it when athletes get cocky or confident in themselves -- I think that's important. Everybody needs that, no matter what profession, no matter what you're doing.

""If you feel you're the best then go ahead and say it and then just go back it up.""

Koepka poses with the Wanamaker Trophy after capturing his second PGA Championship title in 2019.

And Koepka has certainly backed it up. The Floridian has finished inside the top-five in 12 of his 34 career major starts, including three runner-up finishes.

Only five times has he missed the cut, and two of those came during an excruciating season last year.

Koepka's current Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) No. 85 status is the lowest position he has held since 2014 -- albeit with the caveat of his involvement in the LIV Golf Series which, due its exclusion from the OWGR weighting system, has adversely affected the ranking of players who have joined the Saudi-backed series.

Injury woes have compounded a painful fall from the summit for the former World No. 1. After tearing the patella tendon in his left knee in 2019, Koepka revealed this past October that he had ""dislocated and shattered"" his right knee in 2021. The injuries were so severe that the American wondered if his career was over.

His struggle to come to terms with his loss of form was laid bare in Netflix's new fly-on-the-wall golf documentary series ""Full Swing,"" where Koepka admitted his slump was ""the worst"" he had ever suffered in his life.

""There was a lot of stuff ... just in (my) personal life, had gone on. A lot of down times, man,"" Koepka told CNN.

""The injuries, you look back at it and a lot of time you're just sitting there. There's a lot of pain, a lot of stuff you've just got to endure, just to make it better. It's not always fun, not always glamorous.""

Koepka struggled for form during 2022.

Health is wealth

Yet Koepka still carries good memories of 2022, namely his marriage to Jena Sims and a cathartic win at the final individual event of the LIV Golf Invitational Series in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in October.

Alongside brother Chase, he also secured victory in the corresponding team event. Given Koepka had promised to buy his younger sibling a Lamborghini if they won, it put a dent in his $4 million individual winner's earnings, but ultimately ensured a happy ending to a disappointing campaign.

Brooks and Chase Koepka toast their victory at the LIV Golf Invitiational - Jeddah.

""To be able to finally have some happy times, some success with all the down stuff, it was very enjoyable ... something I can really, really look back on,"" Koepka said.

""I could feel the trend coming upwards, (during) the middle of the year -- I was getting out of the funk and just happy to be out of it now.

""Hopefully put all that stuff behind me and stay healthy for a while, that's the goal.""

Naturally though, that isn't Koepka's only goal for 2023. A self-confessed ""slow starter,"" he is looking to be up to speed by the time The Masters rolls around in April.

Runner-up to Tiger Woods in 2019, a green jacket would put Koepka on track for what he considers to be a ""good"" 2023.

98,98,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/03/sport/nfl-players-report-cards-teams-spt-intl,'Get rid of the rats': NFL players rate teams and reveal some 'gross' details,"(CNN) Given the multi-billion dollar nature of the business, you might think that no expense would be spared in ensuring NFL players' every need is taken care of. If so, think again.

In a survey published by the NFL Players' Association (NFLPA) on Wednesday, 1,300 players provided feedback on the league's 32 teams, which were then ranked in a variety of categories.

Look away now if you're a fan of the Los Angeles Chargers, the Arizona Cardinals or the Washington Commanders.

NFL players rated teams in the NFLPA's ""Club Report Cards"" survey based on their treatment of families, nutrition, weight room, strength and conditioning staff, training room, training staff and locker room. They also provided feedback specific to each team.

The Minnesota Vikings were ranked as the best overall: the NFLPA report pointing to the franchise's newly built, state-of-the-art facility, calling the team a ""shining example of what is possible when a concerted investment is made in both staffing and facilities.""

The Miami Dolphins came second, with the only critique being that players would ""like a better post-game family area with more accessibility for players' families."" The Las Vegas Raiders finished third.

At the other end of the scale, the Chargers, Cardinals and Commanders comprised the bottom three.

The Commanders finished last, with the franchise handed an F-minus for their training room, locker room and team travel, while also getting an F for treatment of families.

Complaints from players included an understaffed training room, undersized hot and cold tubs for player recovery, not enough personal space in the locker room and lack of warm water and issues with poor drainage in the showers.

The Chargers and Cardinals didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

In a statement sent to CNN, the Commanders said: ""Player health and safety is our top priority, and we continue to invest in our facilities, including a new practice field, new turf in the practice bubble and increased meeting room space. We know there is more to do, and we regularly talk with our players about ways to improve their work environment and the experience for their families.""

The Washington Commanders celebrate after Milo Eifler completes a play during the first half of the game against the Dallas Cowboys at FedExField on January 8, 2023.

Over one-fifth of players surveyed -- 22% -- also felt they didn't have enough space on team flights, with the Commanders one of seven teams in the NFL that apparently don't offer their players first-class seats.

The Cardinals ranked last in terms of food, with players complaining that they were charged for food at the facility, reportedly the only team to do so.

The team was also criticized heavily for the low standard of its facilities, with some complaining the weight room feels like a ""safety hazard.""

Players labeled the Chargers' hot and cold tubs ""gross.""

Meanwhile, the Jacksonville Jaguars appear to have a bit of a rodent problem.

""When asked what the number one thing they want changed at their facility, the answer was unanimous -- get rid of the rats! Players reported that for 3-4 weeks this season, there was a rat infestation in the locker room and laundry hampers,"" the report said.

The Jaguars didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

The Cincinnati Bengals are one of three teams that do not provide dinner to their players and are the only team that doesn't provide supplements. They are also the only team that does not have outlets in their lockers to charge devices.

The rankings aren't necessarily an indication of success on the field though, with the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs coming in at 29th.

But this time, it's due to investigations into the team's star player.

The Grizzlies lost their second straight game Tuesday without star guard Ja Morant , who had been under investigation by police after the 23-year-old posted an Instagram Live video of himself Saturday appearing to hold a gun at a nightclub outside of Denver.

While police have now decided against charges, the two-time All-Star point guard is the subject of an NBA investigation, a league spokesperson told CNN.

Morant has apologized for his actions via his representation on Saturday, after Memphis announced he would be away from the team

Morant said he would take time away ""to get help and work on learning better methods of dealing with stress and my overall well-being.""

Memphis head coach Taylor Jenkins said Sunday there is no timetable for Morant's return. The team tweeted Wednesday that Morant will miss at least four more games , meaning he will return no earlier than March 17.

Morant is averaging 27.1 points per game in his fourth NBA season.

The Instagram video, posted early Saturday morning and shared widely on social media, shows Morant briefly flashing what appears to be a gun while listening to music at a nightclub.

The police department in Glendale, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, said Wednesday the agency won't recommend charges against Morant.

""(The department) was not able to determine that probable cause existed for the filing of any charges. In this case, it should be noted that on the night in question (police) did not receive any calls for service at the nightclub regarding a weapon of any type,"" department officials said in a statement.

No one made a complaint and investigators concluded no one was threatened or menaced with a gun, police said.

It's unknown why Morant was carrying a gun or if it was his. The Grizzlies played in Houston against the Rockets on March 1 before heading to Denver for a game against the Nuggets on March 3.

If Morant did bring the gun onto team facilities -- which also includes the team plane -- he is subject to NBA discipline according to its Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).

The CBA states that players are prohibited from carrying firearms while ""physically present at a facility or venue owned, operated, or being used by a Team, the NBA, or any League-related entity, and whenever a player is traveling on any NBA-related business, whether on behalf of the player's Team, the NBA, or any League-related entity""

If a player is in violation of the ruling in the CBA, they could face a fine and/or a suspension.

""The Commissioner shall have the power to suspend for a definite or indefinite period, or to impose a fine not exceeding $50,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon any person who, in his opinion, shall have been guilty of conduct prejudicial or detrimental to the Association,"" the CBA reads.

While it is unclear what punishment Morant could face, the most recent example of a gun-related incident came in the 2009/10 season when Gilbert Arenas, a three-time All-Star, was suspended until the end of the season -- 50 games -- for bringing unloaded guns into his team's locker room, and making light of the incident once he was punished.

Arenas pleaded guilty but avoided jail time and was sentenced to two years of supervised probation, was embroiled in a dispute with teammate Javaris Crittenton -- who was also suspended the rest of the season for the incident -- over money in a poker game.

The US government said at the time that Arenas brought at least one firearm into the Washington Wizards' locker room.

Arenas would later return to the Wizards, while Crittenton was released by Washington after his suspension, playing two more years of professional basketball before being charged with murder in August 2011. In April 2015, Crittenton plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter with a weapon and aggravated assault with a firearm and was sentenced to 23 years in prison.

Meanwhile, the Grizzlies are not having a great time of it on the court. Their 112-103 defeat by the Los Angeles Lakers at the Crypto.com Arena in LA on Tuesday came two days after losing in the same building to the Los Angeles Clippers.

124,124,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/16/golf/tiger-woods-genesis-invitational-pga-tour-spt-intl,'I'm here to get that W': Tiger Woods playing to win at first tournament in seven months,"(CNN) In February 1992, a sprightly 16-year-old golf prodigy by the name of Tiger Woods made his first PGA Tour start at the Riviera Country Club in California.

Thursday -- 31 years, 15 major triumphs and 82 PGA Tour wins later -- a very different Woods, one pained by injury, played at the same venue for the Genesis Invitational , a tournament he hosts where proceeds go to his TGR Foundation.

Yet, in terms of his mentality, it will be the same Woods at the tee.

""If I'm playing in the event, I'm going to try and beat you,"" Woods told reporters Tuesday.

""So I don't understand that making the cut's a great thing. If I entered the event, it's always to get a W. There will come a point in time when my body will not allow me to do that anymore, and it's probably sooner rather than later, but wrapping my ahead around that transition and being the ambassador role and just trying to be out here with the guys, no, that's not in my DNA.""

Woods started the tournament Thursday with a 2-under par 69, with birdies on his final three holes. He was five shots back of tournament leaders Max Homa and Keith Mitchell.

After suffering serious leg injuries in a car accident in February 2021, the story of the 47-year-old's recent career has been of one decimated by injury and a grueling recovery process.

Woods' participation in California this week marks his first official tournament start since The Open Championship in July last year and only his first non-major PGA Tour event since the ZOZO Championship in October 2020.

There were a couple of cameos in December -- a father-son outing at the PNC Championship and a friendly battle at TNT's The Match -- but even in those, he looked to be visibly struggling with movement at various points.

His position on playing a limited schedule, picking and choosing a select number of tournaments, remains the same, with Woods earmarking The Masters at Augusta as a potential target. While he revealed his leg has improved, Woods admitted struggles with his ankle mean prolonged spells of walking remain challenging.

""I can still hit shots, but it's the walking endurance that's hard,"" he said.

""That's something that we've had to work on, walking distances on the beach, just basically stress it out but also be able to recover by the next day and see how it is inflammation-wise and then keep practicing.

""I may have overdone it a couple times here or there, but here I am.""

Record in sight

Woods arrives in California on the precipice of greatness. His victory at the 2019 ZOZO Championship tied legendary compatriot Sam Snead for the all-time record of 82 PGA Tour wins, meaning that one more triumph would see Woods become the outright leader.

Snead's feat was a benchmark that once seemed insurmountable until a prodigious talent emerged at the turn of the century. Sound familiar? Earlier this month, LeBron James sunk his 38,388th career point to surpass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA's all-time leading scorer.

""What he [James] accomplished is absolutely incredible -- just the durability, the consistency and the longevity,"" Woods said.

""I grew up watching Kareem here ... that record we never thought it would be surpassed. What LeBron is doing -- but also the amount of minutes he's playing -- no one's ever done that at that age, to be able to play all five positions, that's never been done before at this level for this long.

""As far as our equivalent to that, I don't know, maybe you look at maybe me and Sam [Snead] at 82? It takes a career to get to those numbers. That's how I think probably best how you look at it.""

Woods is one win away from surpassing Snead's record.

Woods Thursday was part of a star-studded grouping, playing alongside four-time major winner Rory McIlroy and two-time major champion Justin Thomas. A smiling Woods finished with five birdies and three bogeys in his round, while McIlroy shot a 4-under 67 and Thomas carded a 68.

McIlroy is vying to instantly reclaim the world No. 1 spot he lost to Scottie Scheffler on Sunday when the American defended his crown at the Phoenix Open . The victory clinched a fifth PGA Tour title for Scheffler, who is excited to go again with the added bonus of Woods on the fairways.

""Tiger means so much to us as players out here on Tour and he's done so much for us out here that it's fun for us to be able to see him still continue to do what he loves,"" he told reporters Tuesday.

""It was pretty scary a few years ago when he got in that accident and we didn't know if he was going to be able to do this again, and so just to have him out here on the grounds and to see him around doing what he loves to do is a lot of fun for us.""

A new look PGA Tour

A $3.6 million winner's reward will be up for grabs, though defending champion Joaquin Niemann will not be in California to defend his title. The Genesis Invitational is one of the PGA Tour's ""designated events,"" offering a boosted prize purse of $20 million to rival the offerings of the LIV Golf Tour, of which Niemann is a part of.

On Tuesday, Woods said that while there were ""mixed emotions"" among players on the Tour's new format, he was optimistic about its development.

""From a marketing side of it and from the Tour side of it and the future of our sport, it's been very positive,"" Woods said.

""We need to keep going with it and need to stay aligned and keep progressing and making it better. We need to produce the best product we possibly can to sell to all the viewerships.

""It's about us creating the best products so we have more eyes on it, more stars, people want to come out and either watch the game of golf, participate, either on social media or the different streaming platforms,"" he added.

Speaking Wednesday, McIlroy said the feedback he had received about the designated events echoed what Woods had heard.

""It's the top half of the membership being really happy that they're in them and... but then the guys maybe on the outside looking in being worried about if they're always going to be on the outside looking in,"" McIroy told reporters.

""I think that the big thing has been, 'Is this going to be like a closed shop for the same guys every single week?' And it's not. This tour was built on meritocracy. This tour was built on if you shoot the scores, you can move up the levels and play the biggest events. That's not going to be taken away.

""It's just about making it more competitive. Ultimately, I think that's a good thing. Like I'm not saying that we're going to have field sizes of 50, it's going to be closer to what you've seen in the past. We're not trying to limit opportunities out here, but we also want to make sure that when people get opportunities, it's the most competitive, most competitive tournaments and the most competitive product that we can put out there.""",['Jack Bantock'],2023-02-16,"in february 1992, a sprightly 16-year-old golf prodigy by the name of tiger woods made his first pga tour start at the riviera country club in california.thursday -- 31 years, 15 major triumphs and 82 pga tour wins later -- a very different woods, one pained by injury, played at the same venue for the genesis invitational , a tournament he hosts where proceeds go to his tgr foundation.yet, in terms of his mentality, it will be the same woods at the tee.""if i'm playing in the event, i'm going to try and beat you,"" woods told reporters tuesday.""so i don't understand that making the cut's a great thing. if i entered the event, it's always to get a w. there will come a point in time when my body will not allow me to do that anymore, and it's probably sooner rather than later, but wrapping my ahead around that transition and being the ambassador role and just trying to be out here with the guys, no, that's not in my dna.""woods started the tournament thursday with a 2-under par 69, with birdies on his final three holes. he was five shots back of tournament leaders max homa and keith mitchell.woods in action at riviera country club in 1992.after suffering serious leg injuries in a car accident in february 2021, the story of the 47-year-old's recent career has been of one decimated by injury and a grueling recovery process.woods' participation in california this week marks his first official tournament start since the open championship in july last year and only his first non-major pga tour event since the zozo championship in october 2020.there were a couple of cameos in december -- a father-son outing at the pnc championship and a friendly battle at tnt's the match -- but even in those, he looked to be visibly struggling with movement at various points.his position on playing a limited schedule, picking and choosing a select number of tournaments, remains the same, with woods earmarking the masters at augusta as a potential target. while he revealed his leg has improved, woods admitted struggles with his ankle mean prolonged spells of walking remain challenging.""i can still hit shots, but it's the walking endurance that's hard,"" he said.""that's something that we've had to work on, walking distances on the beach, just basically stress it out but also be able to recover by the next day and see how it is inflammation-wise and then keep practicing.""i may have overdone it a couple times here or there, but here i am.""woods putts at the pro-am event ahead of the tournament.record in sightwoods arrives in california on the precipice of greatness. his victory at the 2019 zozo championship tied legendary compatriot sam snead for the all-time record of 82 pga tour wins, meaning that one more triumph would see woods become the outright leader.snead's feat was a benchmark that once seemed insurmountable until a prodigious talent emerged at the turn of the century. sound familiar?

Page then fought against American Logan Storley for the interim welterweight championship and lost, meaning Amosov fought Storley for the title at Bellator 291 in Dublin, Ireland on Saturday.

Amosov got a rapturous welcome when he walked to the cage wearing a yellow and blue t-shirt emblazoned with the words ""Colors of Freedom"" on it.

And he outclassed his US opponent throughout the evening, providing no areas of criticism as the judges all scored the fight in the Ukrainian's favor.

Afterwards, draped in an Ukrainian flag, Amosov dedicated the victory to his home country.

""Ukrainian people, I love you. I love you my people,"" Amosov said, with tears of emotion evident. ""Please do not forget what is happening.""

Amosov celebrates winning against Storley at Bellator 291.

Amosov's involvement in the war first became widely known in April last year, when a video he posted of himself recovering his world championship belt from the rubble of his home in Irpin went viral.

""It's a year since the big war started and for me it's a big motivation because I understand what happened and what's going on now in my country,"" a visibly emotional Amosov said at Thursday's press conference. ""I understand that it's been a very hard year for all Ukrainians.

""So I want to talk about this but it's hard sometimes, for my country and me it's hard, but I understand I must do this.""

Amosov is one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world and, at 27-0, currently holds the longest active unbeaten streak in all of MMA, needing just three wins to equal Khabib Nurmagomedov's all-time record of 29-0.

Speaking exclusively to CNN from Irpin in May, Amosov recounted the horror and devastation Vladimir Putin's war has brought to his homeland. He described it as ""destruction.""

Amosov had returned home from a training camp in Thailand four days before the war began. Once Russian troops began advancing, Amosov says he took his wife and six-month-old son to safety on the outskirts of Ukraine before joining the territorial defense to aid civilians in and around Irpin.

""It's hard to look at your city that was once full of happiness, life,"" Amosov told CNN at the time. ""It was always very beautiful here, people were happy, they were happy with their life and took pleasure in it.

Amosov returned to fight in the war in Ukraine when Russia invaded.

CTE, a neurodegenerative brain disease, can be found in individuals who have been exposed to repeated head trauma. Studies have found that repetitive hits to the head -- even without concussion -- can result in CTE.

The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, is pathologically marked by a buildup of tau protein in the brain that can disable neuropathways and lead to a variety of symptoms including memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, aggression, depression, anxiety, impulse control issues and sometimes suicidal behavior.

On a freezing night in north London the Italians comfortably protected the slender advantage they established in the first leg of their last-16 tie at the San Siro as Tottenham huffed and puffed to little effect and exited with a whimper.

Tottenham failed to muster an attempt on target in the first half as their frustration boiled over with manager Antonio Conte booked for letting his emotions get the better of him while they had defender Cristian Romero sent off late on.

Milan could have made it a more comfortable night had they taken any of the good chances they created but in the end a masterclass of game management saw them through.

While Stefano Pioli's Milan can look forward with optimism, Tottenham's season is fizzling out after a dismal week in which they also lost in the FA Cup to second-tier Sheffield United and to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League.

Milan may be some way off returning to their European pomp but while they lack the household names of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Pioli's team had too much craft for a meek Tottenham side who were booed at the final whistle.

""We knew it would be tough, but we managed. I asked the players to show character. We never gave up, and we deserved to progress,"" Pioli said. ""We made it to the quarters, now let's see what happens in the draw.""

THIRD GEAR

The match kicked off 10 minutes late because of traffic issues and in truth Tottenham never got out of third gear.

Considering it was flagged as their biggest game of the season there was a mystifying lack of urgency from the hosts in the first half in which they offered the home faithful nothing to warm their spirits.

Tottenham's three-man attack of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were forced to feed on scraps and while Milan were hardly any more potent they did have the first decent chance when Junior Messias drilled a shot wide.

The Italians came close to taking the lead just after the interval when the ball broke for first-leg scorer Brahim Diaz but his shot was blocked by the legs of Fraser Forster.

With the clock showing 64 minutes Tottenham finally warmed the gloves of Milan keeper Mike Maignan as Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, suspended for the first leg, fired in an angled drive that was parried over for a corner.

As Tottenham committed men forward gaps appeared at the back and Rafael Leao had an effort blocked and then sent another attempt over the crossbar.

Kane sent a stooping header wide as the game began to open up and Tottenham rolled the dice by sending on forward Richarlison in place of wing back Emerson.

Conte was then jeered for hauling off Kulusevski for defender Davinson Sanchez as time ran out.

The 33-year-old Choupo-Moting, who played for PSG from 2018-20, tapped in from Leon Goretzka's assist in the 61st minute and substitute Gnabry struck in the 89th minute to seal the hosts' 3-0 aggregate win after a 1-0 victory in Paris.

The Germans made sure of their last-eight spot after shutting out PSG superstars Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe and are one of the title favourites going into the last eight.

""In the first half, we didn't do what we had talked about t before very well,"" Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann said. ""There was too much space.

""But we defended better in the second half and were dangerous on the ball. In the end, we deserved to win.""

""If we show maximum hunger with emotion and we couple that with our quality then we can achieve anything.""

PSG's long wait to win Europe's premier club trophy for the first time goes on.

Without injured forward Neymar, the French team were sharper in the early stages and went close through Mbappe and a double effort from Messi in the 25th minute.

Bayern gradually took control, however, and had a chance when Jamal Musiala's 32nd-minute shot was blocked by keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.

Despite PSG captain Marquinhos being taken off with a rib injury in the 36th minute, the visitors almost went ahead when under-pressure Bayern keeper Yann Sommer lost possession in the box.

Vitinha's shot with the goal at his mercy was cleared on the line by Matthijs de Ligt in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the game.

The Dutch defender had made an almost identical stop against VfB Stuttgart in the league last week.

With Mbappe largely quiet, it was in-form Choupo-Moting who struck just past the hour for his 17th goal in all competitions this season.

PSG attempted to bounce back instantly and Sergio Ramos's header was saved by Sommer before the Spaniard headed wide but their hopes were shattered when Gnabry rounded off a quick break with the second Bayern goal.

""We did not manage to score when we were on top of things,"" PSG coach Christophe Galtier said.

Kerr fluffed her lines in the 67th minute, missing a great chance after Reiten threaded a beautiful ball through to her, but she made amends by setting up Rytting Kaneryd for a tap-in five minutes later, the Swede's first goal for the Blues.

Tottenham never really threatened to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the first leg and went out with a whimper and boos from the home fans whose patience is running out.

Conte returned to the technical area after missing the last four games following gallbladder surgery but was as subdued as his team on a freezing night in north London.

In six Champions League campaigns with Juventus, Inter Milan, Chelsea and Tottenham, the Italian has only managed to reach the Champions League quarter-finals once.

And with his contract up in June, Wednesday's defeat felt like the beginning of the end of an era even if his side remain in contention to finish in the Premier League top four.

Whether or not Conte remains for the rest of the season is not certain, judging by his comments to Italy's Amazon Prime.

""I continue to work, I have a contract with Tottenham. I respect the contract. At the end of the season, assessments will be made with the club in the most serene way,"" he said.

""Let's see how the season ends. Maybe they can send me away even earlier. Perhaps the expectations were higher and may be disappointed. What matters for a coach is trying to work and raise the bar. This year we are struggling to raise the bar.""

Conte tried to talk about Tottenham's last-16 exit as progress, arguing that last season they were in the Europa Conference League, but the fans are unlikely to agree.

""We played in the Europa Conference League last year and weren't able to get out of the group stages. Now we took a step forward but it is not enough and if we want to be competitive,"" he said. ""We have to fight.""

Tottenham have now failed to score in their last three games, losing in the FA Cup to second-tier Sheffield United, to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League and now barely laying a glove on an average Milan side.

In his news conference later, Conte said he was sorry for the fans but that the club needed to go ""step by step"".

Coach Christophe Galtier's star-studded team that includes striker Kylian Mbappe and world champion Lionel Messi failed to score against Bayern over two legs, losing 3-0 on aggregate and seeing their hopes of clinching Europe's top club trophy disappear for another year.

""It's a big disappointment,"" Galtier said. ""We have to deal with it and accept it. There's a lot of disappointment in the dressing room.""

""I don't know if it's a lesson to be learned, but there's a lot of frustration. If we'd scored first, it would have been different, but we didn't.""

PSG made a strong start and France forward Mbappe had an early opportunity before Messi went close with a double chance of his own in the 25th minute.

""We didn't open the scoring when we had the chance. We did well in the first half, we felt we could match our opponents, but we didn't put away our chances,"" said Galtier.

Instead it was Bayern who opened the scoring when Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting tapped-in in the 61st minute before a late second goal from Serge Gnabry sealed their win.

""We conceded what was a really stupid first goal at this level. Yes, there was pressure from Bayern, but sometimes you mustn't be ashamed to play it long to get over the pressing,"" Galtier said.

""When you're behind after an hour's play, it's difficult.""

His team's latest European failure - their fifth last-16 exit in seven years - adds pressure on Galtier, who refused to speculate on his future at the club.

Jesus, who has scored five goals and chipped in seven assists for Arsenal following his £45 million (US$53.30 million) move from Manchester City in July, has been sidelined since he sustained a knee injury at the World Cup with Brazil, having surgery in early December.

""We will try not to rush him back, we will try to make a fair assessment between what he needs and when is comfortable,"" Arteta told reporters on Wednesday, ahead of their match at Sporting in the Europa League round of 16 on Thursday.

""Everything is going well, he needs time as well to get himself that confidence and that physical state that is necessary to compete with a free mind and once he’s free to do that, we will throw him in.""

Arteta said that Fabio Vieira had been suffering from a sore throat but would be available to play against Sporting.

Kieran Tierney, Eddie Nketiah and Leandro Trossard were absent from Wednesday's training, but Arteta said they were available for the match.

""Let’s see how they evolve. Obviously, we’ve had a few issues in the last few days and I am trying to accommodate everybody and get everyone in the best possible condition for tomorrow,"" Arteta said.

The match will be the fifth meeting between the two teams in European competition, with Arsenal yet to lose or concede a goal.

""The best way to prepare for any competition is to win the previous match and have that confidence and that proper emotion to approach the next game,"" Arteta said.

""Their strength is the idea of the manager, which is very clear. He (Ruben Amorim) has been very successful over the past years.

7,7,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/dominant-rahm-headlines-stacked-field-players-championship-3335011,Dominant Rahm headlines stacked field at Players Championship,"Jon Rahm may have come back down to earth after a strong start to the year but he is still the hottest player going into this week's Players Championship where 2022 champion Cameron Smith will be a notable absentee given his decision to join LIV Golf.

Rahm is the first player since Johnny Miller in 1975 to win three times in a calendar year before March and will headline a loaded field at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, which includes 44 of the top 50 players in the world.

The Spaniard, who opened the season with six consecutive top-10 finishes before settling for a share of 39th last week at Bay Hill, has never missed the cut in five starts at The Players and had his best result in 2021 when he finished ninth.

World number one Rahm counts the 2021 US Open among his 10 wins on the PGA Tour, but the Spaniard is very eager to add a Players Championship title to his resume.

""I mean, winning this event is a big step forward to a Hall of Fame career,"" Rahm told reporters. ""You are The Players Champion. Arguably as close as you can get to being a major champion without officially being one.""

Among the other contenders at TPC Sawgrass, where the winner will get US$4.5 million from a purse of US$25 million, are reigning PGA Tour Player of the Year Scottie Scheffler and four-times major winner Rory McIlroy.

For Scheffler and McIlroy, who have both spent time atop the world rankings this year, a win this week is one of the many scenarios in which they can return to top spot in the rankings.

McIlroy arrives full of confidence after finishing runner-up at Bay Hill where during the final round the Northern Irishman carded successive bogeys from the 14th before a two-putt birdie at the par-five 16th kept his hopes alive.

""As much as I was disappointed that I didn't play the final five holes the way I wanted to, it was still a good week, and I feel like getting into contention last week and sort of having those feelings sets me up well for this week,"" said McIlroy.

2019 TRIUMPH

McIlroy, who will play the first two rounds of the PGA Tour's flagship event alongside fellow major winners Rahm and Scheffler, has four top-10s in 12 starts at The Players, including his 2019 triumph.

Scheffler, who returned to world number one for a week in February after his successful title defense at the Phoenix Open, finished in a share of fourth at Bay Hill where he was also the defending champion.

Max Homa finished in a share of 13th place last year at TPC Sawgrass and will be liking his chances in what will be his third Players start given he is one of two golfers with multiple titles on the PGA Tour this season.

""This place is really tricky, so I think confidence is a big part of the week. It's nice to have that,"" said Homa, who moved to a career-best seventh in the world rankings this week.

""It's kind of fun to arrive at a massive event and not feel like I'm tinkering with anything or trying to do anything different.""

While there will plenty of star power at TPC Sawgrass, one glaring absence will be British Open champion and world number five Smith, who has been banned indefinitely from playing in PGA Tour events after switching to LIV Golf.

Australian Smith is one of five players who finished inside the top-10 last year at TPC Sawgrass who have since fled to LIV Golf, a group that also includes runner-up Anirban Lahiri, Dustin Johnson, Paul Casey and Harold Varner III.

It was a year ago at the tournament in the Southern California desert that the Pole began really to hit her stride amid a scorching 37-match winning streak.

Commonwealth Sport Canada (CSC) announced on Wednesday the Alberta bid, centred around the province's two biggest cities Calgary and Edmonton, as the preferred candidate after Hamilton's bid collapsed.

Hamilton, which hosted the first Commonwealth Games in 1930, had been considered the frontrunner to stage the centennial Games but was unable to obtain the required government backing by the CSC's Feb. 13th deadline.

""If there is one thing athletes and the sporting world know well it is the road to great achievement is never an easy one but it is one worth embarking on,"" said CSC president Claire Carver-Dias, in making the announcement. ""It is my distinct pleasure to announce that Alberta has been selected as Commonwealth Sport Canada's preferred candidate to bid for the 2030 Commonwealth Games.""

The Alberta government will contribute up to $2 million and the city of Edmonton another $1 million to the bid but Roger Jackson, president and CEO of the Alberta 2030 Commonwealth Games Corporation, could not provide a budget for the multi-sport event.

The CSC said it expects to complete the feasibility study in August when a decision will be made on whether to submit a formal bid.

""We are not ready yet to express exactly what that (budget) might be,"" said Jackson. ""We will be working with our government partners to come to a conclusion as to whether or not we advance a bid.""

Calgary hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics but saw hopes of bringing the 2026 Winter Games back to the city dashed when citizens voted resoundingly against it in a plebiscite, something current mayor Jyoti Gondek would not rule out happening again.

""I don't know where things are going to land through the exploration so not sure yet it will require a plebiscite,"" said Gondek. ""I am really hopeful people will see the value of this type of investment.""

If Canada does not put forward a bid it would be another blow for the Commonwealth Games Federation that has struggled to land hosts.

11,11,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/netflix-stars-say-series-shows-ups-and-downs-pro-game-3335501,Netflix stars say series shows ups and downs of pro game,"INDIAN WELLS, Ca. : Rising tennis stars featured in the Netflix tennis docuseries ""Break Point"" said it has raised their profiles and boosted the game's visibility even if it does not always show their best side.

The show, which is filming at Indian Wells again this year, focuses on a group of up-and-coming players including Casper Ruud, Felix Auger Aliassime and Taylor Fritz and as they try to navigate the pressure-filled world of professional tennis.

""One lady came up to me at Publix in Florida and said, 'Me and my husband were watching you last night on the Netflix show',"" Ruud told reporters on Wednesday, the first day of main draw action at Indian Wells.

""But it's not crazy. I haven't been an overnight worldwide superstar.""

One episode follows Ruud's run to the final of last year's French Open and depicts a heated exchange between the Norwegian and the grounds crew after he was not allowed to practise due to forecasted rain.

""I was quite angry honestly because the court crew wouldn't let us warm up before the match,"" Ruud said.

""I don't know if it was good or not but Netflix was there catching it all. It was something I almost forgot had happened,"" he said.

""But it was a little bit funny also, looking back on what can happen sometimes for us. It's not always a smooth ride.""

Canada's Auger Aliassime feels the impact of the show most acutely in the U.S., where Netflix has its biggest market.

""Going to dinner or a grocery store, a lot more people are recognizing me and other players,"" he said.

""They say, 'I just watched your episode and I loved it'. Nice interactions with people who maybe were not tennis fans before.""

Fritz's episode documented his breakthrough victory in the Indian Wells final last year and while he was happy with how it turned out, he said it may have given the wrong impressions about the ankle injury he played through in the title match.

""I thought the episode was really great but there were a couple things that were missed,"" the American said.

""I think the episode made it seem that my injury was in the warm-up before my match but it was at the end of my semi-final and I only realized how bad it felt the next day after.""

Ruud said he kept boundaries up between himself and the crew which limited his screen time.

""I didn't invite Netflix to too many personal things,"" he said.

The Briton told reporters last week that Mercedes were on the wrong track before he finished fifth in Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix opener.

""Last year, there were things I told them. I said the issues that are with the car,"" Hamilton told BBC Radio 5 Live's Chequered Flag podcast.

""I've driven so many cars in my life so I know what a car needs. I know what a car doesn't need. I think it's really about accountability.

""It's about owning up and saying, 'Yeah, you know what? We didn't listen to you. It's not where it needs to be and we've got to work',"" he said.

""We've got to look into the balance through the corners, look at all the weak points, and just huddle up as a team. That's what we do.""

Hamilton is Formula One's most successful driver of all time, with a record 103 wins, but is out of contract at the end of the season.

The 38-year-old failed to win a race last year, a career first for a season, but has dismissed suggestions he might be holding off on a new deal until he knew how competitive his car was.

He told the BBC that there was still time for Mercedes, whose run of eight successive constructors' titles ended last year, to turn the situation around.

""We're still multi world champions, you know? It's just we haven't got it right this time. We didn't get it right last year. But that doesn't mean we can't get it right moving forwards,"" he said.

Team boss Toto Wolff acknowledged in Bahrain that Mercedes needed to rethink the car.

""I don't think this package is going to be competitive eventually,"" said the Austrian of a car that stands out for its slimmed-down sidepods in marked contrast to Red Bull's solution.

""We got it wrong last year, we thought we could fix it by sticking to this concept of car and it didn't work out,"" he added.

Hayes urged Women's Super League clubs to offer more support to players who are mothers.

""If a player tears an ACL, you do everything possible to get them back on the pitch in nine to 12 months,"" Hayes said.

""We should be exactly the same with a woman that has a baby, but we don't. I think we have to ask ourselves more seriously why that is.

Lineker has hosted the BBC's flagship football show Match of the Day for more than 20 years and the charismatic 62-year-old has never been afraid to voice his opinions about political issues like Brexit.

As the BBC's highest-paid employee, Lineker is the face of its sports coverage.

Although the corporation has strict impartiality guidelines, that has not stopped Lineker from airing his views on Twitter where he has over 8.7 million followers.

Matters came to a head on Tuesday when Britain's interior minister Suella Braverman outlined proposals to stop almost all migrants crossing the Channel. Lineker described the policy as ""beyond awful"" and ""immeasurably cruel"".

Lineker wrote on Twitter that the language used in the proposals was not dissimilar to that of Nazi Germany, forcing the BBC to have a ""frank conversation"" with the presenter after Braverman's complaint.

Lineker doubled down on Wednesday, saying he would continue to speak for those who had no voice.

""I have never known such love and support in my life than I'm getting this morning (England World Cup goals aside, possibly). I want to thank each and every one of you,"" he added on Twitter.

Reuters has contacted the BBC for comment.

PROLIFIC STRIKER

As a footballer, Lineker's poaching instincts made him one of the most prolific strikers in the game, although major silverware eluded him.

He made his professional debut for Leicester City in 1978-79 and went on to make over 500 club appearances for the Foxes, Everton, Barcelona, Tottenham Hotspur and Japanese side Nagoya Grampus Eight, scoring nearly 300 goals.

He earned his first England cap in 1984 and by the time he retired was the country's second-highest scorer with 48 goals, behind Bobby Charlton. Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane have since overtaken both.

Lineker played 80 times for his country and his four goals at the 1990 World Cup despite being unwell propelled England to the semi-finals.

Having also top-scored at the 1986 World Cup with six goals, no English player has come close to eclipsing his record of 10 goals at football's global showpiece event, earning him a spot in English Football's Hall of Fame.

Following his retirement, Lineker embarked on a media career, working as a football pundit before taking over as Match of the Day host while also writing columns for British newspapers.

Midway through the 2015-16 campaign, Lineker went viral on social media when he promised to present Match of the Day wearing just his underwear if his former club Leicester went on to win the Premier League title.

Fellow internationals Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Kadidiatou Diani have also said they were taking a step back from the national team.

The 35-year-old Serb said his Dubai participation was in doubt until a few days ago but he had passed all his fitness tests.

22,22,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/future-looking-bright-manchester-united-ten-hag-delivers-silverware-3307216,Future looking bright at Manchester United as Ten Hag delivers silverware,"LONDON: Manchester United's near six-year trophy drought was almost overlooked in the build-up to the League Cup final as Newcastle United's wait for major silverware spanned nearly seven decades.

A clinical 2-0 victory at Wembley got the Old Trafford trophy cabinet door swinging open again though and, perhaps more importantly, gave a glimpse of greater things to come under astute Dutch manager Erik ten Hag.

The former Ajax Amsterdam boss arrived at Old Trafford with the club in a state of some turmoil on and off the pitch after finishing in sixth place in the Premier League last season.

But while there is little he can do about the future ownership of the 20-time English champions, which the American Glazer family have expressed a wish to sell, on the pitch he is shaping a team that looks capable of reviving the glory days.

A season that began under a Cristiano Ronaldo-shaped cloud has been transformed since the Portuguese talisman was finally shown the door after a toxic fall-out.

Ten Hag has quietly gone about his business, moulding an intelligent team that works tirelessly and is beginning to make winning a habit. A sixth League Cup triumph ended the club's longest wait for a trophy since 1983.

And the season could still get better. They are in the fifth round of the FA Cup, the last 16 of the Europa League after knocking out Barcelona in midweek and in third place in the Premier League and not out of the title race.

Ten Hag experienced some difficult early days. A 4-0 hammering at Brentford in August had some predicting he might be out before the leaves fell off the trees and then there was a humiliating 6-3 defeat at Manchester City.

Since that drubbing at The Etihad in early October, United have lost only twice in all competitions, forward Marcus Rashford has turned into a world-beater and the signing of midfielder Casemiro has looked like a stroke of genius.

A header by Casemiro followed by an own goal by Sven Botman late in the first half silenced the hordes of Newcastle fans who flocked to the capital full of optimism as Manchester United went on to lift the trophy for a sixth time with relative ease.

Much of the build-up was about Newcastle's first appearance in a major final since 1999 and an uptick in their fortunes instigated by Eddie Howe since a 2021 Saudi Arabia-led takeover.

But Erik ten Hag's resurgent United side showed them how far they still need to go as they claimed the club's first trophy since winning the Europa League under Jose Mourinho in 2017 - their longest wait for silverware since 1983.

""It has been an amazing period, first trophy of the season but we want more it is not enough for this club, we want more and we need more because our standards demand more,"" Bruno Fernandes, who was denied a third goal in stoppage time, said.

""For me it was about winning trophies and finally we did it. I am satisfied but I want more. I want much more.""

There was little between the sides in a scrappy first half but the English season's first silverware was effectively decided in the space of six minutes towards halftime.

Newcastle were stunned when Brazilian Casemiro met a superb Luke Shaw free kick in the 33rd minute to head past Loris Karius, the goal allowed to stand after a VAR check for offside.

Six minutes later Newcastle were left totally deflated when the in-form Marcus Rashford was played in down the left and his shot deflected over a helpless Karius for what initially appeared to be his 17th goal since the World Cup.

However, it was credited to the unfortunate Botman.

Kicking towards their fans in the second half Newcastle roused themselves into action and pinned a leggy-looking United back at times but they rarely looked like scoring.

Newcastle's fans, who had created a sea of black and white with give-away plastic flags at the stadium's west side during the closing minutes, drifted away before the presentation.

The Tyneside club has now lost each of their last nine matches at Wembley, a run that began in the 1974 FA Cup final.

Former Germany coach Klinsmann replaced Paulo Bento, who stepped down following South Korea's defeat by Brazil in the World Cup last 16 in December.

The Korea Football Association (KFA) said Klinsmann had signed a contract until the 2026 World Cup, which will be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

""I know that the Korean national team has been improving and achieving results over a long period of time,"" Klinsmann said in a statement.

Kane secured the three points for Spurs when he pounced at the far post after a corner by Son Heung-min was flicked on by Eric Dier in the 82nd minute.

Mbappe, who bagged a double, was set up by Messi for both his goals, and repaid the favour by laying on another for the Argentine forward as PSG, who were without the injured Neymar, moved to 60 points from 25 games with second-placed Marseille on 52.

France forward Mbappe, who was on the losing side against Messi's Argentina in the World Cup final, became PSG's joint record scorer with 200 goals - level with Edinson Cavani - while Messi netted his 700th in club football.

""We were aggressive, we put intensity into the game, that's what we'd been missing,"" said PSG centre back Sergio Ramos.

Marseille coach Igor Tudor said he did not regret his side's high-risk approach.

""Why should we have changed our way of playing? It has been working well this season,"" he said.

""Mbappe's presence didn't change anything. His presence made it more difficult for us to play our game but we were not going to change it.""

Third-placed Monaco slumped to a 3-0 home defeat against Nice, who prevailed thanks to a Terem Moffi double and a superb half-volley by Khephren Thuram.

The result left Monaco on 50 points, ahead of fourth-placed RC Lens on goals scored after the northerners drew 1-1 at Montpellier on Saturday.

PSG, who were knocked out of the French Cup in the last 16 by Marseille earlier this month, ended a three-game losing streak in all competitions by beating Lille last weekend and they were focused throughout at the Velodrome.

They suffered an early injury blow when Presnel Kimpembe, who missed the World Cup for France with an Achilles issue, left the pitch on a stretcher, two weeks after making his comeback from a three-month layoff.

Matteo Guendouzi created danger as Marseille pressed high and hard but they were exposed on the counter and the hosts were punished in the 25th minute when Messi played Mbappe through for the France forward to race into the area and beat Pau Lopez with a low shot.

The roles were reversed four minutes later as Mbappe delivered a pin-point cross for Messi, who tapped in from point-blank range to double the advantage in front of an all-time Ligue 1 record attendance of 65,800.

Messi then missed a sitter and Mbappe was denied by Lopez after being found in the area by the Argentine again, just before Marquinhos's angled shot went just wide as Marseille were again caught on the break.

Messi beautifully lifted the ball into the path of Mbappe, who volleyed home with his left foot for his 16th goal of the season in Ligue 1.

Gianluigi Donnarumma made a spectacular save from Nuno Tavares's header in the 67th to snuff out any hope of a Marseille comeback as PSG secured a first clean sheet in six league games.

Barca are top of the league standings on 59 points, seven ahead second-placed Real Madrid who were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Atletico Madrid on Saturday. Almeria are 15th on 25 points, two clear of the relegation zone.

Almeria halted Barca's seven game winning streak in the league and delivered another blow to the Catalans who, after going unbeaten in 18 matches in all competitions, have now lost two straight matches after being knocked out of the Europa League on Thursday.

The hosts were the better side in the first half and scored after 24 minutes when Luis Suarez sent a perfect long pass to Toure who was ghosting behind Barca's defence. The Malian striker ran towards the area and hit a thunderous strike in off the crossbar.

It was only the eighth goal Barcelona have conceded in La Liga this season, the least of any team in the top five leagues in Europe.

Almeria should have extended their lead but Leo Baptistao's strike was blocked by goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Rodrigo Ely then missed a sitter from close-range, sending wide a header from a corner when he was all alone in the area.

""I'm very angry because I think we made the worst game of the season by far, mainly in the first half,"" Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez told Movistar Plus.

28,28,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/inter-title-hopes-fade-more-misery-bologna-3306706,Inter title hopes fade with more misery in Bologna,"BOLOGNA, Italy: Inter Milan suffered a damaging 1-0 defeat at Bologna on Sunday (Feb 26) which virtually ended their slim hopes of winning the Serie A title.

At the same ground where their title aspirations were dealt a fatal blow last season, Riccardo Orsolini's goal condemned Inter to another loss.

Simone Inzaghi's team are second in the standings on 47 points from 24 matches, 18 behind leaders Napoli who beat Empoli 2-0 on Saturday.

Inter will also be looking over their shoulders with concern at AC Milan and AS Roma, who are level on 44 points and are yet to play in this round of fixtures. Bologna are seventh on 35 points.

Bologna thought they had taken the lead at a rain-sodden Stadio Renato Dall'Ara through Musa Barrow in the 12th minute, only for the effort to be ruled out following a VAR review.

Minutes later, Roberto Soriano rattled the woodwork on the rebound after Andre Onana had parried Andrea Cambiaso's volley into his path.

Inzaghi, missing Federico Dimarco, Milan Skriniar and Joaquin Correa through injury, rested Nicolo Barella among a raft of changes from their midweek Champions League win over Porto, and his much-changed Inter team lacked fluidity.

They had brief spells of possession in the first half, but created few clear-cut chances as Lautaro Martinez headed an Alessandro Bastoni cross just wide of the target and Henrikh Mkhitaryan twice fired over the bar.

Bologna continued to press forward after the break, and Andre Onana kept his side in the game with two crucial saves in quick succession, getting a hand to a Soriano shot before smothering Dominguez's effort from the edge of the area.

Romelu Lukaku and substitute Edin Dzeko each had a shot on target, but it was Bologna who broke the deadlock in the 76th minute when Orsolini raced on to Jerdy Schouten's pass and powered a shot into the net.

Odion Ighalo scored four and Moussa Marega netted twice while Salem Al Dawsari was also on target for the four-time winners from Saudi Arabia, who will now take on Urawa over two legs on April 29 and May 6.

The pair last met in 2019 when Al Hilal avenged a loss to the J.League side in the 2017 final and Maciej Skorza's side will face a major challenge to deny Al Hilal a record fifth title.

Ighalo put Al Hilal in front with barely 90 seconds on the clock when Mohammed Kanno's persistence set up the former Manchester United striker with the simplest of headed finishes, and the onslaught soon gathered unstoppable momentum.

The Nigerian added a second in the 10th minute having seen Al Duhail goalkeeper Salah Zakaria deny him five minutes earlier.

But when Brazilian winger Michael Oliveira centred, after being released down the right by defender Jang Hyun-soo, Ighalo made no mistake.

Four minutes later Marega slotted in following Al Dawsari's centre from the left and the Mali international made it 4-0 in the 28th minute when he latched onto goalkeeper Abdullah Al Mauoif's long punt down the middle.

Al Dawsari hit his side's fifth seven minutes before the interval when he swept in Marega's clever backheel and the former Porto forward thought he had claimed a sixth for his side, only for his volley to be ruled out by VAR for offside.

Ighalo ensured there was to be no respite for Al Duhail at the start of the second half when he clipped the ball over Zakaria to complete his hat-trick three minutes after the interval.

He then hit his fourth in the 62nd minute, converting from Abdullah Al Hamdan's cut-back to put the seal on the most comprehensive win and keep Al Hilal on track to become the first team to claim back-to-back titles since Al Ittihad in 2005.",[],,"defending champions al hilal crushed qatar's al duhail 7-0 at al thumama stadium in doha on sunday to secure their place in the final of the asian champions league and set up a third meeting in six years with japan's urawa red diamonds.odion ighalo scored four and moussa marega netted twice while salem al dawsari was also on target for the four-time winners from saudi arabia, who will now take on urawa over two legs on april 29 and may 6.the pair last met in 2019 when al hilal avenged a loss to the j.league side in the 2017 final and maciej skorza's side will face a major challenge to deny al hilal a record fifth title.ighalo put al hilal in front with barely 90 seconds on the clock when mohammed kanno's persistence set up the former manchester united striker with the simplest of headed finishes, and the onslaught soon gathered unstoppable momentum.the nigerian added a second in the 10th minute having seen al duhail goalkeeper salah zakaria deny him five minutes earlier.but when brazilian winger michael oliveira centred, after being released down the right by defender jang hyun-soo, ighalo made no mistake.four minutes later marega slotted in following al dawsari's centre from the left and the mali international made it 4-0 in the 28th minute when he latched onto goalkeeper abdullah al mauoif's long punt down the middle.al dawsari hit his side's fifth seven minutes before the interval when he swept in marega's clever backheel and the former porto forward thought he had claimed a sixth for his side, only for his volley to be ruled out by var for offside.ighalo ensured there was to be no respite for al duhail at the start of the second half when he clipped the ball over zakaria to complete his hat-trick three minutes after the interval.he then hit his fourth in the 62nd minute, converting from abdullah al hamdan's cut-back to put the seal on the most comprehensive win and keep al hilal on track to become the first team to claim back-to-back titles since al ittihad in 2005."

Bristol City, who are managed by Nigel Pearson, have been unbeaten in all competitions since the last week of December, moving up to 13th in the second-tier Championship.

The last time the two teams faced each other at Ashton Gate, Manchester City edged Bristol City 3-2 in the League Cup semi-finals second leg in 2018 en route to Guardiola's first trophy with the English club.

""From my experience in this country, in the last six years, when you go (play) away in the FA cup at a Championship team, it is always, always tough. (Playing at) home is a little different,"" Guardiola told reporters ahead of Tuesday's clash.

""Last 12 games - no defeat. That means they are there. My scouts are saying it's a good team. The manager has experience, did really well with Leicester (City) and Watford when he was there one or two seasons ago.

""It's a final. The FA cup is a really, really important competition, so it's a serious team we will play tomorrow.""

Manchester City bounced back from two consecutive draws to beat Bournemouth 4-1 over the weekend but Guardiola feels the team can play better as they sit two points behind league leaders Arsenal, who have a game in hand.

""The way we are playing is good, results could be better. Sometimes it happens in football,"" Guardiola said.

""I have no complaints about how we are playing and how we are fighting. The mood in the locker room is exceptional and the guys are doing everything - that is enough for me.

The Caribbean side are coming off a 1-0 series win in Zimbabwe earlier this month, but before that were thumped in Australia late last year and will face similar seamer-friendly conditions on their short tour of South Africa.

""It won’t be easy, South Africa are a tough team at home, but we are looking forward to playing some hard days of test cricket,"" Brathwaite told reporters on Monday.

""It is important we take control of every hour, and not look at the big picture, just go from session to session.""

West Indies have lost 12 of their previous 15 tests in South Africa and won just one, though this is the first time they have toured the country in the longest format since 2015. Their only victory was a surprise success in Gqeberha 16 years ago.

Brathwaite, who opens the batting, concedes it will be a big step up from what they faced in Zimbabwe and it will be up to the batters to lay the platform for success against the home side's vaunted pace attack on helpful wickets.

""Zimbabwe isn’t a top team in the world so we are really looking to challenging ourselves here. We need to improve as batters and it is important as openers to set the foundation or the team,"" he said.

Can Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton add to his record tally of 103 victories?

There are plenty of storylines to the season that starts in Bahrain on March 5. The following looks at some of them.

TRIPLE MAX

Verstappen will start as favourite for a third title in a row. The Dutch driver won 15 races last year. How many can he bag this time? And can team mate Sergio Perez get closer to him?

NEW BOSSES

Four of the 10 teams have new principals since 2022.

Fred Vasseur has replaced Mattia Binotto at Ferrari, joining from Sauber/Alfa Romeo in January.

McLaren's Andreas Seidl has joined Sauber, appointing Alessandro Alunni Bravo to what is effectively a principal role, with Andrea Stella stepping up at McLaren while James Vowles moved from a strategy role at Mercedes to boss of Williams.

FERRARI

Can Vasseur bring a title to Maranello for the first time since the 2008 constructors' championship?

The Frenchman's arrival has drawn comparisons with compatriot Jean Todt, who led the team through a golden era with Michael Schumacher in the early 2000s.

NEW FACES

There are three rookies on the grid.

Australian Oscar Piastri joined McLaren in controversial circumstances after a contract dispute with Alpine while Nyck de Vries has replaced Pierre Gasly (now with Alpine) at Red Bull-owned AlphaTauri.

Logan Sargeant will meanwhile be making his debut at Williams as the first grand prix racer from the United States since Alexander Rossi in 2015.

OLD FACES

Nico Hulkenberg starts his comeback at Haas, his first full season drive since 2019, with the German still chasing a first podium finish after 179 starts.

Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, now 41, and Hamilton, 38, are the oldest drivers. Can either become the first driver to win a race after reaching the milestone of 300 starts? Alonso has made 355, Hamilton 310.

LAS VEGAS

Las Vegas promises to be the big and brash event of the year with a Saturday night race on the Strip in November as the penultimate round of the season and the hype in over-drive.

Formula One's popularity in America is already surging thanks to Netflix series 'Drive to Survive'.

NEW TEAMS

Andretti Cadillac are seeking to become the 11th team on the grid from 2026. Will the sport let them in?

MERCEDES

Mercedes, champions eight years in a row, had a tough 2022 with a 'porpoising' car that proved hard to handle. Can they close the gap to Red Bull and Ferrari?

NEW DEAL

Hamilton is out of contract at the end of the year and talks on a new one have started. He will be asked about it regularly.

SPEAKING OUT

The governing FIA has tweaked the rules on drivers making political, personal and religious statements. How will they and the stewards react?

35,35,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/french-football-bracing-itself-black-tuesday-3309396,French football bracing itself for Black Tuesday,"PARIS : French football is bracing itself for a major shakedown as both the president of the federation (FFF) and the women's head coach are expected to resign from their positions on Tuesday.

Noel Le Graet, who has been head of the FFF since 2011, has already taken a step back amid a legal investigation into alleged sexual and moral harassment and a damning audit commissioned by the Sports ministry, will be at the centre of Tuesday's executive committee.

Should he refuse to step down, Le Graet, 81, could be brought before the FFF's disciplinary committee or the executive committee could resign to force new elections.

""Given the failures in governance, his seriously inappropriate behaviour towards women, I can only agree with the conclusion of the report: he no longer has the legitimacy to administer and represent French soccer,"" Sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera said earlier this month.

Le Graet, who also came under fire when he made dismissive comments about France great Zinedine Zidane after extending men's coach Didier Deschamps's contract until 2026, could be followed into the abyss by the women's coach, Corinne Diacre.

Diacre's position has become untenable since team captain Wendie Renard said last week that she would not play at this year's Women's World Cup to preserve her mental health.

Fellow internationals Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Kadidiatou Diani following suit soon after her announcement, all saying they were taking a step back from the national team.

Renard, who is widely considered one of the best defenders in women's football, played for France in international games against Norway, Denmark and Uruguay earlier this month.

According to a report in French multimedia outlet RMC Sport, Renard will not play for the national team as long as Diacre is in charge.

The 48-year-old Diacre, who in 2014 became the first French woman to coach a men's team when she took charge of then Ligue 2 side Clermont, was appointed France head coach in 2017.

Renard was stripped of the captaincy by Diacre following their quarter-final exit at Euro 2017, before regaining it in 2021.

Diacre had previously attracted criticism from other French players, including Gaetane Thiney and Sarah Bouhaddi.

The coach was also criticised at the European Championship in England last year for leaving out influential senior players Amandine Henry and Eugenie Le Sommer, their all-time leading goalscorer (86 goals), in her squad of 23.

France were eliminated in the semi-finals by Germany.

""I can no longer support the current system, which is far from the requirements of the highest level,"" said Renard.

36,36,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/new-skipper-bavuma-looking-fresh-start-south-africa-3309161,New skipper Bavuma looking to fresh start for South Africa,"South Africa start their two-test home series against West Indies at Centurion Park on Tuesday with a clean slate and a new positive attitude to their style of cricket, according to recently appointed captain Temba Bavuma.

South Africa lost four tests in a row prior to a rain-affected draw in Australia earlier this year, though they were on their way to defeat in that match too.

The batting remains the major concern with the side having not scored more than 255 in any of their last 10 innings, which has led to recalls for Aiden Markram and Ryan Rickelton, and a potential first cap for Tony de Zorzi.

""It's the start of a new journey and we start with a clean slate. We want to go out there and play the way we want to play. It’s going to be exciting to see how that looks on the field,"" Bavuma told reporters on Monday.

""The batting unit (struggled) in the last two series in England and Australia, but those are tough tours, generally ones that separate the good guys from the really good guys.

""The guys who are still here want to man up as the batting unit, we need to score runs to give the bowlers the room to do what they need to do.""

South Africa will likely play an extra batsman at number seven with Heinrich Klaasen to keep wicket, and go in with an all pace attack on the bouncy Highveld wicket in Pretoria.

The 35-year-old, a three-times Grand Slam champion, is no stranger to hip problems and was on the verge of retirement in 2019 after having surgery the previous year.

However, he got his career back on track after another operation and stormed into his fourth ATP final since returning to the tour at last week's Qatar Open where he was beaten by Daniil Medvedev.

""We regret to inform you that Andy Murray is unable to participate in this year's tournament,"" Dubai organisers said in a post on Twitter. ""Andy has been dealing with a recurring hip injury that has unfortunately forced him out of Dubai.""

Murray said after his defeat by Medvedev that he would have to manage his body better, especially after physically demanding matches.

""At my age and with some of the issues that I've got, I do have to be mindful of those things. I cannot just keep going until something happens,"" Murray said.

""I need to be a bit smarter with that.""

The former captain hit paceman James Anderson through midwicket for four with the fourth ball of the morning at Wellington's Basin Reserve on day four to pass Taylor's mark of 7,683 runs.

By tea, Williamson had chalked up his 26th century in tests to give the hosts some hope of pulling off an unlikely win after they were asked to follow on.

As always, the mild-mannered 32-year-old from Tauranga kept the emotions in check, barely acknowledging the warm applause from the crowd after taking the runs record.

Later in the day, after being caught behind for 132 off Harry Brook's part-time medium pace, Williamson showed he has lost none of his discomfort talking about his achievements.

""It's not something that I've sort of thought about a whole lot but it is an honour,"" he told reporters of the record.

""I look at that list and I've admired all of those players over the years, whether that's watching from afar growing up or playing alongside a number of them as well.

""It's not a focus point, but it's special to be amongst that company.""

A nation of 5 million, New Zealand has produced a slew of brilliant cricketers over the decades but none have made their mark with the bat quite like Williamson.

Taylor's tally of runs came from 112 matches, while Williamson, now on 7,787 runs at an average of 53.33, is playing his 92nd test.

Former team mate Taylor, who retired last year, was quick to congratulate him.

""This achievement is a testament to your hard work and dedication to test cricket, of which I was privy to for a number of years,"" he said.

""Here’s to many more.""

Williamson managed only 10 runs across his three previous innings of the series against England but answered the team's call for a big score on Monday.

He batted superbly through a 282-ball knock, anchoring partnerships with Henry Nicholls (29), Daryl Mitchell (54) and Tom Blundell (90) in New Zealand's second innings of 483.

Tim Southee's side will bid to record just the fourth win in history by a team asked to follow on.

Should they pull it off, they will have their quiet talisman Williamson to thank for setting up the chance.

The left-armer suffered the injury to the middle finger of his bowling hand and was sidelined as Australia lost the opening two tests of the four-match series against India.

With skipper Pat Cummins and batter David Warner ruled out of the contest, the tourists are likely to welcome back Starc and all-rounder Cameron Green.

""There's going to be a level of discomfort for a while, I don't think it is going to be 100 per cent for a fair while,"" Starc said on Monday. ""But it's certainly good enough. The ball's coming out quite nicely and I feel I'm pretty much at full tilt.

""It wouldn't be the first test match I've played in some sort of discomfort. If I only played when I was at 100 per cent I would have only played five or 10 tests.

""I'm happy with where it's at and I've got enough of a pain threshold to deal with that stuff over the last 10 or 12 years.""

Cummins has returned home to be with his ailing mother, leaving Steve Smith, who captained Australia between 2015 and 2018, to lead the side in his absence.

Starc felt the quicks still had a big role to play in the series, which has so far favoured the spinners.

""It's been a challenge in the last couple of weeks, the first two tests,"" he said.

""We do see spin playing a huge part in this test series but the quicks have still played a particular role, whether it be with the new ball, if it does reverse-swing, and being able to bowl that skiddy ball and bring the stumps into play.

""So there's certainly an important role to play for the seam bowlers.""

'NOT UNPLAYABLE'

Indian wicketkeeper Srikar Bharat said the turning wickets that have so far proven to be big challenges for Australia were not totally unplayable.

Bharat scored an unbeaten 23 off 22 deliveries to take India home in the second test in New Delhi and said his mindset was to keep things simple.

""The wickets aren't unplayable,"" said Bharat. ""If you apply yourself and back your defence, there's scope for a batsman to score runs.

The visitors defended superbly after Real centre back Eder Militao scored an own goal in the first half, managing to overcome the loss of key players like Robert Lewandowski, Pedri and Ousmane Dembele who missed the game due to injuries.

Barca earned a much-needed win after arriving in the Spanish capital under pressure having been knocked out of the Europa League and losing at lowly Almeria to halt a seven-game winning streak in LaLiga.

""We would have liked to have the ball more, to control de game a little more but we fought hard and competed in a high level. They had the ball but didn’t create many chances. We got the advantage for the second leg and that’s really important,"" Barcelona captain Sergio Busquets told TVE.

Real Madrid started better and dominated the first 15 minutes, but Barcelona started to turn things around as they took control the midfield and their defensive game plan worked brilliantly.

Barca centre back Ronald Araujo did a great job at right back to neutralise the threat of the dangerous Vinicius Jr. and Karim Benzema was left alone up front.

Real became frustrated and tempers flared before the hosts made the crucial mistake which gave Barca the winner.

Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga gifted a back pass to Ferran Torres who reacted quickly to slide the ball to Franck Kessie.

His point-blank strike was saved but bounced off Militao and into the net.

The assistant referee signalled offside but the VAR replay showed Kessie was fractionally onside and the goal stood.

Barcelona locked Real Madrid into an even tighter situation during the second half and although the hosts dominated possession, they rarely threatened to equalise.

Real did not record a single shot on target despite having almost 70 per cent of possession in the second half and Barca should have extended their lead in the 71st minute when a Kessie shot that beat the goalkeeper was blocked by Ansu Fati.

Substitute Rodrygo had Real’s best chance with a late long-range strike that flew narrowly wide of the post.

The 35-year-old Serbian won in Adelaide before sealing his 22nd Grand Slam trophy at the Australian Open while managing a hamstring injury and has hit top form after a slow start in Dubai on his return to the tour.

Having breezed through the first set on the back of a single break, Djokovic found the going a bit tougher in the next as the big-serving Hurkacz raised his game in search of a first win over the world number one in their fifth meeting.

After a crucial hold from 0-30 down to draw level at 5-5, Djokovic grabbed another break to heap the pressure on Hurkacz and the five-times champion closed out the match on serve.

""It was a challenging match as it always is against Hubert,"" Djokovic said. ""I think he's got one of the best serves in the game. In the second set, until the 11th game I didn't have too many chances against his serve.

""Fortunately for me, I also found the rhythm on my serve... one or two points can decide the winner in matches like these.

""I'm really glad with the way I played under pressure.""

Up next for Djokovic is a meeting with former world number one Daniil Medvedev, who beat Borna Coric 6-3 6-2.

Alexander Zverev earlier reached his first semi-final since last year's French Open with a 7-5 6-4 win over Lorenzo Sonego.

The seventh seed has had a torrid time after injuring his ankle at Roland Garros and undergoing surgery, only returning to the ATP tour in December after suffering a bone edema problem during his rehabilitation.

44,44,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/alonso-privileged-have-raced-longer-piastris-age-3320381,Alonso privileged to have raced for longer than Piastri's age,"MANAMA: Oscar Piastri was not yet born when Fernando Alonso made his Formula One debut and both said on Thursday (Mar 2) they felt privileged at the prospect of racing each other in Sunday's Bahrain season-opener.

Aston Martin driver Alonso's first appearance for now-defunct Minardi was the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on Mar 4, 2001. Piastri was born in the same city on April 6 of that year.

While Piastri makes his debut, the race will be Alonso's record-extending 356th F1 start.

""Privileged to still drive here, better than ever. I have no concerns on age yet,"" Alonso, 41, told reporters at the Sakhir circuit with Piastri sitting in the same FIA press conference for the first time as a Formula One driver.

Piastri, who was reserve to Alonso at Renault-owned Alpine last season, returned the compliment.

""It's a privilege to race against Fernando obviously. I grew up watching him. My first go-kart ever was a Fernando Alonso kart, actually,"" he said.

""On paper, it sounds a little bit strange ... for Fernando's career to be longer than I've been alive but it's a big privilege to race against someone like Fernando.""

Alonso pointed out that Ferrari's Carlos Sainz, McLaren's Lando Norris and former F1 racer Daniil Kvyat had also started out with one of his karts.

Asked how many years he felt he had left to win a third title, Alonso said: ""I don't know. Eight? 10?

When asked to ""be honest"", he replied: ""five"".

Piastri is one of three rookies this season, although AlphaTauri's Nyck de Vries actually made his F1 debut at Monza last year as replacement for Alex Albon at Williams.

Bavuma, 32, was installed as the new test skipper just weeks before the two-test series when Dean Elgar was stripped of the job after heavy defeats in both England and Australia over the last six months for South Africa.

But while Bavuma led his side to a comfortable 87-run win over the West Indies on Thursday, his own performance left much to be desired.

He earned the unwanted distinction of becoming the fourth player to get a pair of ducks on his test captaincy debut after Mark Taylor (Australia), Rashid Latif (Pakistan) and Habibul Bashar (Bangladesh).

Bavuma was dismissed second ball in the first innings and first ball in the second innings, which will fuel the debate over his place in the team and continuing to select a batsman who has scored a single century in 95 test innings.

But he was not the only failure with the bat as South Africa, who had won the toss, elected to bat and score 342 in the first innings only to wilt in the second innings and make 116.

It set the West Indies a target of 247 runs but they fell well short as the pace bowlers dominated the contest.

“We did not get many partnerships. The wicket did not get easier, there was variable bounce,” said Bavuma.

“But our lead eventually proved to be a lot. The bowlers need to rest, it was a big effort from them. The batters need to get together and work on our game plan. We need to do better next time,” he said after the victory.

The seven times world champion was asked about human rights in Bahrain and neighbouring Saudi Arabia, which hosts the second round.

It was the first time he had faced the media at a grand prix since the re-wording of the international sporting code last December to require written permission to make or display ""political, religious and personal statements or comments"".

The new rules cover podium ceremonies and anthems but drivers can make statements ""in their own space"" such as social media and official news conferences in response to direct questions.

Hamilton has said nothing will stop him speaking out.

""I’ve always felt that we have a responsibility and if the sport is going to go to these countries we are duty bound to raise awareness and try to leave a positive impact in these places,"" he told reporters in the Mercedes hospitality at Sakhir.

""That view has not always been shared within the sport, whether its teams or people in high-powered positions, but more needs to be done without doubt.

""Whether or not that will happen, time will tell.""

Asked about the human rights situation in Bahrain and Formula One's impact, he said he was ""not sure it’s got better while I’ve been coming all these years.""

The Briton was speaking in a crowded room with only three female reporters among the men - an imbalance he was also happy to speak out on.

""This sport still has a lot more work to do in the diversity space,"" he said when asked about the general absence of female figures in the latest run of the popular Netflix docu-series 'Drive to Survive'.

""It’s definitely not good ... there are a lot of women out there that are watching Drive to Survive that are watching the sport.

""If they are not seeing that it’s possible for them to be there, or there’s a place for them there, that’s counter-intuitive to our values and what should be. It is still very much a male-dominated space,"" he added.

The sport's most successful driver of all time, now 38, is out of contract at the end of the season that starts in Bahrain on Sunday but has said a new deal will be done.

Hill, the 1996 world champion, wrote in a recent column for the Daily Telegraph newspaper that Hamilton might be ""less-minded to sign a new long-term deal"" if the car were miles off the pace.

Button, 2009 champion, was quoted by the Independent as saying his fellow-Briton could be tempted to retire if the wins dried up.

Seven times champion Hamilton told reporters at Sakhir on Thursday that ""it's ultimately people creating rumours without facts.

""It's never helpful, and you would have thought that they would both know me by now,"" he added.

""I have been with Mercedes since I was 13... and whether or not we have a difficult year this year, I will still be here. I am a fighter and we fight as a team.

""I love the challenge of finding solutions and I still believe I am able to put the car in places that perhaps others are not able to.

48,48,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/barcelona-renegotiate-deal-finance-stadium-revamp-3320101,Barcelona renegotiate deal to finance stadium revamp,"MADRID: Barcelona are renegotiating the terms of a €1.5 billion (US$1.59 billion) financial plan with Goldman Sachs to revamp their stadium and may have to repay the debt five years earlier than anticipated, according to a rating agency and a high-level club source.

Barcelona approved a 35-year debt plan in a referendum of club members in 2021 that would enable them to renovate their iconic but languishing Camp Nou stadium and its surroundings.

The preliminary debt structure has been revised, the Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) said in reports published on its website, with Barca to make a final repayment in 2047 instead of 2052 as previously agreed..

The original plan represented the only source of funding for the Nou Camp project. Under the amended structure, notes would be issued for €1.3 billion, with the remainder of the deal made up of a 200 million euros bank loan maturing in 2028, the KBRA report said.

KBRA said the revised structure included additional refinancing and interest rate risk and as a result it had downgraded the financing plan's rating from BBB+ to BBB, meaning it is less attractive to investors.

A source at the club confirmed the revised debt structure but said the terms of the deal were still being negotiated with Goldman Sachs and that the definitive deal would be announced by Mar 31.

Goldman Sachs has not replied to a request for more information about the ongoing talks and the new terms.

Camp Nou is the largest football stadium in Europe and the fourth largest in the world by capacity with 99,354 seats but the club considers it no longer offers a full match-day experience for fans.

The club estimates the new stadium will allow Barca to generate 200 million euros of additional revenue annually through sponsorship and naming rights, ticketing, catering, VIP boxes, hospitality, meetings and events.

Barcelona have announced that Turkish construction company Limak will carry out the renovation and work will start in June.

Club president Joan Laporta, who presided over one of Barca's most successful periods from 2003 to 2010, was re-elected two years ago after the previous board resigned due to the club's worsening finances and other issues.

He inherited a club deep in a financial crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Restricted by LaLiga's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, Barca were unable to agree a new deal with club great Lionel Messi, who left as a free agent to Paris St Germain in 2021.

Since then Laporta has tried to improve the club's financial situation, turning the club's assets into cash and bringing in new sponsors.

In March 2022, the club signed a shirt and stadium sponsorship deal with audio streaming platform Spotify (SPOT.N) in an agreement worth 280 million euros.

Barca have also agreed to sell a 25 per cent stake in their La Liga TV rights for the next 25 years to US private equity group Sixth Street for 607.5 million euros and approved the sale of a minority share of their audio-visual division to Socios.com and Orpheus Media for 200 million.",[],,"madrid: barcelona are renegotiating the terms of a €1.5 billion (us$1.59 billion) financial plan with goldman sachs to revamp their stadium and may have to repay the debt five years earlier than anticipated, according to a rating agency and a high-level club source.barcelona approved a 35-year debt plan in a referendum of club members in 2021 that would enable them to renovate their iconic but languishing camp nou stadium and its surroundings.the preliminary debt structure has been revised, the kroll bond rating agency (kbra) said in reports published on its website, with barca to make a final repayment in 2047 instead of 2052 as previously agreed..the original plan represented the only source of funding for the nou camp project. under the amended structure, notes would be issued for €1.3 billion, with the remainder of the deal made up of a 200 million euros bank loan maturing in 2028, the kbra report said.kbra said the revised structure included additional refinancing and interest rate risk and as a result it had downgraded the financing plan's rating from bbb+ to bbb, meaning it is less attractive to investors.a source at the club confirmed the revised debt structure but said the terms of the deal were still being negotiated with goldman sachs and that the definitive deal would be announced by mar 31.goldman sachs has not replied to a request for more information about the ongoing talks and the new terms.camp nou is the largest football stadium in europe and the fourth largest in the world by capacity with 99,354 seats but the club considers it no longer offers a full match-day experience for fans.the club estimates the new stadium will allow barca to generate 200 million euros of additional revenue annually through sponsorship and naming rights, ticketing, catering, vip boxes, hospitality, meetings and events.barcelona have announced that turkish construction company limak will carry out the renovation and work will start in june.club president joan laporta, who presided over one of barca's most successful periods from 2003 to 2010, was re-elected two years ago after the previous board resigned due to the club's worsening finances and other issues.he inherited a club deep in a financial crisis exacerbated by the covid-19 pandemic. restricted by laliga's financial fair play (ffp) rules, barca were unable to agree a new deal with club great lionel messi, who left as a free agent to paris st germain in 2021.since then laporta has tried to improve the club's financial situation, turning the club's assets into cash and bringing in new sponsors.in march 2022, the club signed a shirt and stadium sponsorship deal with audio streaming platform spotify (spot.n) in an agreement worth 280 million euros.barca have also agreed to sell a 25 per cent stake in their la liga tv rights for the next 25 years to us private equity group sixth street for 607.5 million euros and approved the sale of a minority share of their audio-visual division to socios.com and orpheus media for 200 million."

50,50,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/czech-olympian-nash-cleared-doping-after-dog-medicine-defence-3321131,Czech Olympian Nash cleared of doping after dog medicine defence,"Veteran Czech cyclist Katerina Nash has avoided a four-year ban after a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) investigation determined the five-time Olympian's positive test had been a result of administering medicine to her pet dog.

Nash, 45, tested positive for the appetite stimulant capromorelin after providing an out-of-competition urine sample on Oct. 24 2022, USADA said.

Capromorelin is not specifically listed on WADA's ""Prohibited List"" but is considered by the global anti-doping body to be a non-specified substance in the class of peptide hormones, growth factors, related substances and mimetics.

It is banned at all times under USADA and International Cycling Union anti-doping protocols.

California-based Nash provided records of a prescription liquid pet medication containing capromorelin.

""She was administering the medication orally to her dog each day during the final weeks of her pet’s life in an effort to maintain weight,"" USADA said in a statement.

Due to the difficulty of administering the medication Nash came into contact with it via her hands. The bottle did not warn users about the risk of contamination from exposure to skin.

Working with lab experts USADA established that such exposure would cause a positive test, the agency said.

It therefore concluded Nash had no fault or negligence and would not be sanctioned.

If she had not been cleared, Nash, who competed as a skier at two winter Olympics before switching to cycling, faced a four-year ban.

""As in this case, we always work as hard to try to exonerate the truly innocent as we do to convict those who intentionally cheat,"" said USADA boss Travis Tygart.

USADA disclosed Nash's no-fault violation in keeping with WADA rules but Tygart said the rules needed to change.

""If there is no question that an athlete comes into contact with a prohibited substance from a completely innocent source and there is no effect on performance, USADA continues to advocate that there should not be a violation or a public announcement,” he said.

Gerry Cardinale, the founder of RedBird Capital, was asked about reports that banks and investment funds were keen to acquire a share of Serie A's media rights operation.

52,52,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/english-clubs-spending-more-after-brexit-changed-immigration-system-masters-3320401,English clubs spending more after Brexit changed immigration system - Masters,"LONDON : The new visa system put in place after Brexit is a contributory factor to Premier League clubs spending record sums on transfer fees as they find it more difficult to sign players at a younger age, the league's chief executive Richard Masters said on Thursday.

A UEFA report published last month showed the January transfer window was dominated by English clubs who spent a total of 830 million euros ($878 million) which accounted for 53 per cent of global transfer spending.

English clubs cannot sign Europe-based players under the age of 18, however, and Masters said at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London that the immigration system ""needs a bit of a tweak"".

""Whilst we're totally committed to developing young, homegrown players and we want (England manager) Gareth Southgate to be successful... when you have a limited supply of players you can go for and you've got lots of demand, then it's slightly inflationary,"" Masters said.

""That's certainly not the only reason why lots of money and records are being broken in the Premier League transfer window, but it's a contributing factor.""

The UK Home Office has a points-based Government Body Endorsement (GBE) system based on which clubs must apply to England's Football Association to sign players.

""Ultimately we have generated an earned advantage over our European investors and a lot of that earned advantage goes to those European investors in transfer fees for players that we can no longer buy at a younger age,"" Masters added.

""Some of this has nothing to do with the GBE system. It's just that if you're outside Europe, we can't buy younger players in the same way that you could before, but it's partially to do with the GBE system.""

BIGGEST SPENDERS

Chelsea were the biggest spenders having laid out more than 500 million pounds ($596 million) in two windows since an investment group led by American Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital took over the club in May last year.

Their massive outlay of nearly 300 million pounds on eight players in January - which included the 106.8 million-pound signing of Enzo Fernandez - was more than the combined totals of all clubs in the Bundesliga, LaLiga, Serie A and Ligue 1.

Their spending raised questions on how they would comply with Financial Fair Play regulations but Masters said they needed to be judged over a period of time.

""I'm not here to defend the new owners who have owned the club for less than a year and had two transfer windows,"" Masters said.

A threatening hand-written message for 35-year-old Messi, Argentina's captain and seven-times World Player of the Year, was also left on the shop door.

""Messi, we are waiting for you, (Pablo) Javkin (the mayor) is also a narco, he is not going to take care of you,"" it read.

Javkin blamed the security forces for failing to effectively combat organized crime, which in recent years has grown in the important port city, where dozens of ships daily load thousands of tons of grain.

""I spoke (with the Roccuzzos) and they are worried,"" Javkin told reporters outside the supermarket that was attacked.

Television images showed bullet casings on the sidewalk where the business belonging to Roccuzzo's family is located. The front of the building was hit by 14 bullets and the shop remained closed on Thursday morning.

Santa Fe's Security Minister Claudio Brilloni told reporters that authorities did not have any firm assumptions regarding the motives for the attack. Prosecutor Federico Rébola said the Roccuzzo family had not received any previous threats, a Rosario media outlet reported.

On the official Twitter account ""Team Messi"" and Antonela Roccuzzo's Instagram profile there were no mentions of the incidents.

The murder rate in Rosario is among the highest in Argentina, as gangs linked to drug trafficking coexist, according to judicial complaints, and clashes causing injuries and deaths are frequently reported.

The attack came weeks before Argentina play two friendly matches in the South American country, three months after Messi led the team to victory in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Neither game will take place in Rosario. Argentina face Panama on March 23 in the capital Buenos Aires and on March 28 they play in the province of Santiago del Estero against Curacao.

Newcastle's takeover by a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) was rubber-stamped in October 2021 after ""legally binding assurances"" that the Saudi government would have no control of the north-east club.

However, a U.S. court case concerning the PGA Tour and LIV golf this week described Newcastle chairman and PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan as a ""sitting minister of the government,"" casting doubt on the independence of the club's ownership.

""The Premier League will surely need to re-examine the assurances made about the non-involvement of the Saudi authorities in the Newcastle deal, not least as there's still a Qatari bid for Manchester United currently on the table,"" said Peter Frankental, Amnesty's UK economic affairs director.

Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani, a member of the Qatar royal family, is fronting one of the two groups who are seeking a full takeover of Manchester United.

The brief filed in the PGA Tour case against LIV Golf described the Public Investment Fund as ""a sovereign instrumentality of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.""

PIF is chaired by Saudi Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman. Six of the other eight board members are Saudi government ministers, according to PIF's website, while one is Advisor at the Royal Court and Al Rumayyan is Governor of the PIF.

""It was always stretching credulity to breaking point to imagine that the Saudi state wasn't directing the buyout of Newcastle with the ultimate aim of using the club as a component in its wider sportswashing efforts,"" Amnesty's Frankental was quoted as saying by the BBC.

""There's an unmistakable irony in the sovereign wealth fund declaration emerging in a dispute about another arm of Saudi Arabia's growing sports empire, but the simple fact is that Saudi sportswashing is affecting numerous sports and governing bodies need to respond to it far more effectively.""

LIV Golf and the PGA Tour have been in litigation since several LIV players filed federal antitrust lawsuits last August.

:Runaway leaders Napoli will look to extend their eight-match winning run in Serie A when they host Lazio on Friday but face a stern test against the second-best defence in the league.

Lazio climbed back into the fourth and the final Champions League spot after beating visiting Sampdoria 1-0 on Monday but they will not find it easy against a Napoli side who have kept four consecutive clean sheets while scoring 10 goals.

Napoli have one hand on the title with an 18-point lead over second-placed Inter Milan and manager Luciano Spalletti has nothing but praise for his team as they look to end a 33-year wait for the Serie A title with 14 games left.

""Everyone we face seems to be playing for their lives and if we're where we are at this stage of the season it means I have a group of lads who know how to handle every game the right way,"" he said.

""(They are) displaying the mindset and the spirit you need as a squad if you want to come out on top in every game.""

Juventus are on the rise again after a 15-point deduction related to the club's transfer dealings saw them plunge from third to 10th place. Four wins in a row have lifted them to seventh in the table ahead of their visit to Roma on Sunday.

Massimiliano Allegri's side are six points behind sixth-placed Atalanta, who occupy the last European slot, and have been boosted by the return from injury of Paul Pogba.

The France midifelder came off the bench to make his first appearance in his second stint since his return to Juve in Tuesday's 4-2 home win over Torino.

Roma will be without manager Jose Mourinho after the Portuguese coach was banned for two games and fined 10,000 euros ($10,628) for his explosive reaction to being sent off in his side's 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Cremonese.

Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic is back in the Milan squad after a lengthy injury layoff and the striker might even make his first start of the season on Saturday at Fiorentina, against whom he has scored 11 times in Serie A.

If he finds the net, the 41-year-old will set the record as the oldest scorer in the history of the competition, overtaking former Milan player Alessandro Costacurta.

Udinese visit Atalanta on Saturday and will attempt to break the home side's 10-match unbeaten run against them in Serie A.

Inter have won each of their last eight home games against Lecce in Serie A, but manager Simone Inzaghi has warned about the impact of their unforgiving schedule.

62,62,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/novak-djokovic-atp-tennis-world-rankings-number-1-3314351,Djokovic says return to top spot more special after tough year,"Novak Djokovic said his return to the top of the world rankings felt like a big achievement after a year of turmoil where he had to skip several tournaments including two Grand Slams, but the Serbian expects a see-sawing battle for the position in 2023.

Djokovic missed the 2022 Australian Open and was deported from the country due to being unvaccinated against COVID-19 before returning this year to clinch a record-extending 10th title at Melbourne Park and 22nd major to reclaim the number one spot.

He was forced out of big tournaments in the United States last year, including the US Open, as he was unable to enter the country due to his refusal to take his shots.

The 35-year-old also received no points for winning the Wimbledon title due to the grasscourt Grand Slam being penalised for its decision to ban players from Russia and Belarus over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

""I think this is the least points I've had as number one. It happens,"" Djokovic told reporters following his win over Tomas Machac in Dubai on Tuesday (Feb 28).

""It's not only due to my circumstances of not playing a couple of Grand Slams and everything that happened last year, but also other players, some players missing some slams for injuries, some not having the biggest consistency.

""I guess that makes the achievement bigger, at least in my team's and my eyes. I'm overwhelmed with pride. I work as hard as anybody else. I'm really committed to the sport. And I try.""

Djokovic is now into his 378th week as the world number one, surpassing Steffi Graf's record for the most weeks at the top of the sport.

But he said younger players like Carlos Alcaraz and Stefanos Tsitsipas will eventually catch up with him.

""These guys are playing at a high level constantly. They're playing a lot of tournaments. I'm not playing as much and don't plan to play as many weeks as they do,"" Djokovic said.

Djokovic, who surpassed Steffi Graf's record for the most weeks as world number one after starting his 378th at the top of the rankings, moved with ease and showed no lingering effects of the hamstring tear he managed at Melbourne Park last month.

But there were some signs of rust especially on Djokovic's serve, which seemed to fail him midway through the opening set, before he regained control and took the early advantage in the match when Machac sent a return long.

The five-times Dubai champion was in a spot of bother while trailing 3-0 in the next set after dropping serve again and made 16 unforced errors to allow big-hitting Machac to take the contest into a decider.

Machac began to struggle with a right wrist issue early in the third set and Djokovic pounced for a 3-1 lead but the Czech mounted a comeback with a break of his own to level at 4-4 with some superb ball-striking along the way.

Machac blinked first in the tiebreak and Djokovic did not need another invitation as he finally quelled the world number 130 to extend his 2023 winning streak to 13 matches.

""Tomas didn't play like a world number 130. He played great tennis and deserves all the applause. He was giving me all kinds of trouble but when it mattered most I found another gear,"" Djokovic said.

The world number two, who was scheduled to play his opening match later on Tuesday, picked up the injury during his loss to Cameron Norrie in Sunday's Rio Open final where the pain hindered both his movement and serve.

""I have a grade 1 strain in my right hamstring that will keep me out for several days, according to the tests we did this morning,"" Alcaraz wrote on Twitter.

""I'm really sad I can't compete here, but now it's time to think about recovering and being ready as soon as possible. I hope to see you all soon!""

After spending more than three months out of action due to abdominal and hamstring injuries, Alcaraz returned to the ATP Tour in February at Buenos Aires where he beat Norrie in the final for his first title since last year's U.S. Open.

At the Rio Open, the 19-year-old Spaniard needed treatment for a left leg problem during his semi-final and then picked up an injury to the other leg in the match against Norrie during which he needed his leg wrapped midway through the final.

Norrie also pulled out of the tournament in Mexico saying he needed to rest.

The Briton, who leads the ATP Tour in match victories this season with 18, is scheduled to return to action at the Indian Wells hardcourt event beginning next week.

65,65,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/nadal-withdraws-indian-wells-and-miami-due-injury-3313111,Nadal withdraws from Indian Wells and Miami due to injury,"Rafa Nadal said on Tuesday he had decided to withdraw from two upcoming Masters 1000 hardcourt events in Indian Wells and Miami due to injury.

The 22-times Grand Slam champion, who has not competed since his Australian Open title defence ended in a second-round loss during which he aggravated a hip problem, said he had started rehab and physiotherapy as instructed by doctors.

""I am sad that I won't be able to compete at Indian Wells nor Miami. Very sad not to be there,"" read a message posted on Nadal's Twitter account. ""I'll miss all my US fans but I hope to see them later this year during the summer swing.""

Nadal lost in straight sets to Taylor Fritz in last year's Indian Wells final and then skipped the Miami Open so that he could focus on his claycourt preparation.

The 36-year-old Spaniard is a three-times champion at Indian Wells having triumphed in 2007, 2009 and 2013. Nadal has reached the Miami final five times but has never won the title and has not competed there since 2017.

""We wish Rafa continued healing, and hope to see him back at the BNP Paribas Open next year,"" Indian Wells tournament director Tommy Haas said in a statement.

At the Australian Open, top seed Nadal tweaked his left hip while running for a backhand in the second set at Rod Laver Arena, and after inspection from a trainer when trailing 6-4 5-3, he went off-court for a medical time-out.

Foden struck in the seventh minute but it was not an entirely comfortable night for Pep Guardiola's side until the England forward's deflected effort made it 2-0 late on.

Kevin De Bruyne then gave the scoreline an emphatic look with a sublime finish from 25 metres although it was harsh on Bristol City who had been on a 12-match unbeaten run and pushed the Premier League champions hard.

Leicester were booed off after a 2-1 home defeat by second-tier Blackburn Rovers for whom Tyrhys Dolan and Sammie Szmodics were on target before a Kelechi Iheanacho reply.

Fulham reached the sixth round for the first time in 13 years with superb goals by Joao Palhinha and Manor Solomon earning them a 2-0 win over fellow top-flight side Leeds United.

Brighton and Hove Albion's hopes of a first ever major trophy remained intact as Evan Ferguson's first-half goal sealed a 1-0 win over second-tier Stoke City.

Guardiola named a strong side, as he invariably does in domestic cup competitions, and City began the game in dynamic style with Kalvin Phillips hitting the crossbar.

City did not have to wait long to take the lead though with Foden firing high into the roof of the net from Riyad Mahrez's pass across the face of goal.

The hosts did not buckle though and had a good shout for a penalty declined when Mark Sykes went down under a challenge from Rico Lewis in the area while Alex Scott forced a decent save from City keeper Stefan Ortega.

Bristol City, who were spared having to deal with rested Erling Haaland, were still very much in the game until De Bruyne split their defence with a ball to Nathan Ake whose pass eventually fell to Foden whose shot deflected into the net off of Zak Vyner.

""It was really tough. Bristol showed us how good they can be. I was impressed by some players, I didn't know them. The second half was much better,"" Guardiola said.

Promotion-chasing Blackburn thoroughly deserved their win at Leicester whose form remains wildly unpredictable.

""It's just consistency and mentality and ambition to succeed. That's been too up and down for us,"" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said.

""I'm really disappointed for the supporters. It's been a real challenge for them this season. The FA Cup was an opportunity to get to a quarter-final, against a Championship team at home, but they were a lot better than us, and we have to be worried about that.""

Fulham's magnificent season continues under Marco Silva with the Cottagers still chasing a European qualification spot on two fronts. They were not at their best against Leeds who had a host of chances and a goal disallowed but still showed their quality.

Palhinha struck a superb curled effort after winning the ball after 21 minutes and Israeli Solomon's 56th-minute goal was almost as impressive.

""It is great for us to go to the quarter-final,"" Silva, whose side are sixth in the Premier League, said.

""We know our story with the FA Cup is not great and we are here to try and change it.""

Liverpool are seventh in the standings, nine points adrift of Tottenham Hotspur in fourth place, but Klopp's side have two games in hand, with arch rivals Manchester United visiting Anfield on Sunday.

Liverpool played Wolves twice in the FA Cup, winning the replay 1-0 before losing 3-0 in the reverse league fixture earlier this month and Klopp said he hoped to learn from their mistakes in that defeat.

""Nothing I saw in training suggests we don't have a chance. We know a lot about each other and we know it won't be easy. There won't be the most surprising information and we have to make sure we are ready,"" Klopp told reporters.

""It is a super important week, we cannot ignore that. We have two home games ... I would love to give the season a little push in this week and we need results for that. And for results we need good performances.

""The main difference is we will play at Anfield and we have to make that count. It's a long period between games, we want to put it right. But I am more focussed on giving the season a proper push, we need to find a steady mood.""

Liverpool still have several injuries, however, with influential midfielder Thiago Alcantara still sidelined with a hip problem while defender Joe Gomez is also ruled out with a muscle injury.

The club did receive a boost with Luis Diaz back in training after a knee injury but Klopp said the Colombian forward has not trained with the team yet.

Uruguayan striker Darwin Nunez is a doubt with a shoulder injury but Klopp said it was 'massive' to have former Wolves winger Diogo Jota back after the Portugal international returned from a calf injury that had ruled him out of the World Cup.

""Diogo is an exceptional player. He needs to get rhythm now,"" Klopp said.

68,68,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/drivers-urged-help-steer-f1-away-moral-vacuum-3312756,Drivers urged to help steer F1 away from 'moral vacuum',"LONDON: Lewis Hamilton and other Formula One drivers can help steer the sport away from a 'moral vacuum' by speaking out at season-opening races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, human rights campaigners said on Tuesday.

Paul Scriven, a member of Britain's House of Lords, told a news conference organised by the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) that the sport was at a fork in the road.

""There are two roads that F1 can now take. One is a road which is a moral vacuum where the leaders and the administrators seem to going,"" he said.

""There is another road that some drivers seem to be taking ... who understand they can use their platform and their sport not just for sport's sake but for good and for change and that they cannot ignore the human rights abuses in the country that they are driving in.""

Mercedes driver Hamilton, a seven-times world champion, has used his profile to address rights abuses and racial injustice around the world.

The sport's governing body updated the sporting code last December requiring drivers to get prior written permission to make or display ""political, religious and personal statements or comments"".

Hamilton, who said in 2021 that Formula One cannot ignore issues in the countries it visits, has vowed to continue speaking out and other drivers have said the same.

Bahrain hosts the opening race on Sunday, with the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on Mar 19.

BIRD said human rights in the two countries had been ""increasingly trampled on"" since last year's grands prix and accused Formula One of helping to ""facilitate sportswashing of abuses.""

It called for an independent enquiry to examine the role of races in human rights violations.

The accusation of 'sportswashing' is levelled at countries who are perceived to be using sport to improve a tarnished image abroad.

BIRD said it had written to Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali urging him to meet victims and use ""all available leverage"" to seek the release of jailed activists.

A statement was read out on behalf of families of 12 prisoners BIRD said were facing death sentences in Bahrain.

The Sunni-ruled state, a US ally, crushed an anti-government uprising led largely by the Shi'ite Muslim community in 2011.

Bahrain's government has said it ""actively supports the role Formula One can play in shedding light on human rights issues in all countries it operates in"".

69,69,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/former-france-great-fontaine-has-died-report-3315191,World Cup finals record goal-scorer Just Fontaine dies,"PARIS: Just Fontaine, the all-time top scorer in a single World Cup finals with 13 goals, has died aged 89, his family told AFP on Wednesday (Mar 1).

Fontaine achieved the record during the 1958 finals in Sweden, where France reached the semi-finals for the first time in their history.

To this day, only three players have scored more World Cup goals than Fontaine, even though the Reims player appeared at just one tournament and played only six matches.

Lionel Messi matched his tally on Argentina's recent run to glory in Qatar, but it took him five World Cups to get there.

That 1958 World Cup in Sweden is best remembered as the coming of age of a 17-year-old Pele, who inspired Brazil to victory after netting a hat-trick in their 5-2 semi-final win over France.

However, it was a personal triumph for Fontaine, whose four-goal haul in the third-place playoff win over West Germany ensured that he had scored in every game.

Part of a wonderful attacking trident alongside Roger Piantoni and Raymond Kopa, Fontaine might never have gone to Sweden at all.

Only injuries to Thadee Cisowski and his Reims teammate Rene Bliard saw him make the squad and then the starting line-up.

""It was only at the airport before leaving for Sweden that Paul Nicolas (part of the national team staff) and Albert Batteux (the France coach), who didn't really want me, told me I would be playing as centre-forward,"" Fontaine told AFP in 2013.

Only Germany's Miroslav Klose (16), Brazil's Ronaldo (15) and Gerd Muller, the West German hero of the 1970s who scored 14 times, have netted more World Cup finals goals.

Just two other players - Muller with 10 in 1970 and Hungary's Sandor Kocsis with 11 in 1954 - have reached double figures at a single World Cup.

Yet, Kopa is remembered as the biggest French star of the era. When he died in 2017, Fontaine remembered fondly his ""big brother"".

""Raymond had character,"" he said. ""So did I, and that made us a magical duo.""

70,70,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/upbeat-new-zealand-back-same-squad-deliver-against-sri-lanka-3314896,Upbeat New Zealand back same squad to deliver against Sri Lanka,"New Zealand selectors have backed the same squad that held a rampaging England to a 1-1 draw to beat Sri Lanka in the two-test series starting in Christchurch next week.

They saw no need to tinker after New Zealand pulled off an incredible one-run win in the second test in Wellington on Tuesday after being asked to follow on by England captain Ben Stokes, coach Gary Stead said.

Opener Devon Conway was nursing a groin strain at the Basin Reserve and paceman Matt Henry had tightness in his back, but both were expected to be fit and available for Christchurch.

Faith in the playing group has been restored quickly, with Stead admitting after the 267-run defeat in the first test in Mount Maunganui that New Zealand were down on confidence.

""We felt that the 13 that we have here is the right 13 to go forward,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. ""I think when you have a win like that (in Wellington), whether you win or lose, your confidence will improve.""

Having won the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC) in 2021, New Zealand's title defence is already over, but the Sri Lanka series has ramifications for this year's championship.

Sri Lanka could sneak into the WTC final if they whitewash New Zealand and if Australia are swept by India in the ongoing four-test series.

India, leading the home series 2-0, need only one more victory to secure their place in the final.

New Zealand will look to regroup for the next WTC but Wellington shed much of the gloom that has engulfed the side since a slew of seasoned players retired or opted out of test cricket last year.

Kane Williamson scored a century in a welcome return to form while wicketkeeper Tom Blundell had a terrific test with the bat and behind the stumps.

New Zealand's main concerns lie in their bowling, with quality quicks thin on the ground after Trent Boult's decision to opt out of his national contract and Kyle Jamieson's continuing back problems.

The Black Caps have also been unable to unearth a high-quality all-rounder to replace Colin de Grandhomme and provide support for pacemen Tim Southee, Henry and Neil Wagner.

All-rounder Michael Bracewell laboured in that role in Wellington where his deficiencies as a part-time spinner were exposed and his batting contributed only 46 runs in four innings.

Those concerns were set aside on Wednesday as the team soaked up acclaim in the nation's media for pulling off the 'Miracle at the Basin' and protecting their unbeaten record in home test series dating back to 2017.

""I think we’ve had (character) in the team all the time I’ve been there,"" Stead said. ""And probably before that as well. When you look back over the last 10 years or so we’ve been a team that have punched above our weight and I think yesterday was a great example of that.""",[],,"new zealand selectors have backed the same squad that held a rampaging england to a 1-1 draw to beat sri lanka in the two-test series starting in christchurch next week.they saw no need to tinker after new zealand pulled off an incredible one-run win in the second test in wellington on tuesday after being asked to follow on by england captain ben stokes, coach gary stead said.opener devon conway was nursing a groin strain at the basin reserve and paceman matt henry had tightness in his back, but both were expected to be fit and available for christchurch.faith in the playing group has been restored quickly, with stead admitting after the 267-run defeat in the first test in mount maunganui that new zealand were down on confidence.""we felt that the 13 that we have here is the right 13 to go forward,"" he told reporters on wednesday.

Benn, 26, also criticised the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) for lacking consideration for his mental state and reiterated his innocence in a statement on social media on Tuesday.

The WBC ruled on Feb. 22 Benn's ""highly elevated consumption of eggs"" was a reasonable explanation for failed tests last year. It found no procedural failures and no conclusive evidence that Benn had intentionally ingested the banned substance Clomiphene.

Positive findings for ""trace amounts of a fertility drug"" in a random test carried out by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) led to Benn's fight with compatriot Chris Eubank Jr being called off in October.

""In my defence to the WBC and the 270-page report provided to them, at no point did I indicate that I failed any VADA tests because of contaminated eggs,"" Benn said. ""I feel like the WBC statement did a disservice to my defence.

""As part of its lengthy investigation, the WBC instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet, and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause.

""My sample appears to have come back clear the first three times it was tested. Without explanation it was retested again after nine days and only then did it show a trace positive result.""

Benn, whose father Nigel was a super-middleweight world champion, relinquished his licence with the BBBofC after his fight with Eubank Jr was called off. He remains under investigation by UKAD, Britain's anti-doping body.

The BBBofC said last Wednesday it was not part of the WBC's review.

""I have never previously failed any kind of anti-doping test, and passed multiple tests with both UKAD and VADA in close proximity to the two tests that returned adverse findings,"" Benn added.

""This adds further proof to my belief that the findings were testing errors.

On a track where the ball spun viciously from the first session, Matt Kuhnemann (5-16) and Nathan Lyon (3-35) engineered India's spectacular collapse in 33.2 overs.

Usman Khawaja then showed how to master those conditions as he made 60 and raised 96 runs for the second wicket with Marnus Labuschagne to put Australia ahead.

The visitors, who are 2-0 behind in the four-test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, finished the frenetic opening day 47 runs ahead with six wickets in hand.

Peter Handcomb was batting on seven at the close with Cameron Green on six at the other end.

""I just started playing with my plans and trying to score when I saw a scoring opportunity and respected the good ball when it was there,"" Khawaja said of his batting approach.

""It's not rocket science to be honest. It was nice to get out there and get a partnership with Marnus.""

Beaten inside three days both in Nagpur and Delhi, Australia persisted with a three-pronged spin attack but had to make a couple of changes to their battered squad.

Stand-in skipper Steve Smith introduced spin after five overs of pace bowling by Mitchell Starc and Green, both of whom returned from finger injuries to play their first match of the series.

Regular skipper Pat Cummins is back home to be with his ailing mother, while opener David Warner has returned having fractured his elbow in Delhi.

India captain Rohit Sharma was left to rue his decision to bat first and he himself could have been dismissed twice in the first over from Starc, but Australia did not challenge those on-field decisions.

It did not really matter though once the spinners took over.

Kuhnemann removed Rohit (12) stumped and, in his next over, cut short Shubman Gill's (21) promising knock to unhinge India.

Lyon then joined the party, dismissing Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja in his successive overs and India slumped to 45-5 after a frenetic opening hour.

Virat Kohli (22) gamely hung on for a while but once Todd Murphy trapped him lbw, wickets started tumbling and India eventually wilted half an hour into the second session.

After the innings break, India predictably began with spin from both ends and Travis Head (nine) fell lbw to Ravindra Jadeja (4-63) in the second over of the innings.

Labuschagne, who made 31, combined with Khawaja to steady the innings and had luck on his side too.

The batsman was yet to open his account when he dragged the ball onto his stumps but bowler Jadeja was found to have over-stepped.

This was the third time in the series that Jadeja's penchant to bowl no-balls cost him a wicket.

Labuschagne got another reprieve later when India opted against reviewing an lbw decision against him and replays subsequently confirmed the batter would have been dismissed had they done so.

Jadeja eventually removed Labuschagne just before Australia drew level and went on to pick the crucial wickets of Khawaja and Smith (26).",[],,"indore, india :australia bundled out india for 109 and batted resolutely to reach 156 for four in reply, giving the home side a taste of their own medicine on a raging turner in indore on wednesday.on a track where the ball spun viciously from the first session, matt kuhnemann (5-16) and nathan lyon (3-35) engineered india's spectacular collapse in 33.2 overs.usman khawaja then showed how to master those conditions as he made 60 and raised 96 runs for the second wicket with marnus labuschagne to put australia ahead.the visitors, who are 2-0 behind in the four-test series for the border-gavaskar trophy, finished the frenetic opening day 47 runs ahead with six wickets in hand.peter handcomb was batting on seven at the close with cameron green on six at the other end.""i just started playing with my plans and trying to score when i saw a scoring opportunity and respected the good ball when it was there,"" khawaja said of his batting approach.""it's not rocket science to be honest. it was nice to get out there and get a partnership with marnus.""beaten inside three days both in nagpur and delhi, australia persisted with a three-pronged spin attack but had to make a couple of changes to their battered squad.stand-in skipper steve smith introduced spin after five overs of pace bowling by mitchell starc and green, both of whom returned from finger injuries to play their first match of the series.regular skipper pat cummins is back home to be with his ailing mother, while opener david warner has returned having fractured his elbow in delhi.india captain rohit sharma was left to rue his decision to bat first and he himself could have been dismissed twice in the first over from starc, but australia did not challenge those on-field decisions.it did not really matter though once the spinners took over.kuhnemann removed rohit (12) stumped and, in his next over, cut short shubman gill's (21) promising knock to unhinge india.lyon then joined the party, dismissing cheteshwar pujara and ravindra jadeja in his successive overs and india slumped to 45-5 after a frenetic opening hour.virat kohli (22) gamely hung on for a while but once todd murphy trapped him lbw, wickets started tumbling and india eventually wilted half an hour into the second session.after the innings break, india predictably began with spin from both ends and travis head (nine) fell lbw to ravindra jadeja (4-63) in the second over of the innings.labuschagne, who made 31, combined with khawaja to steady the innings and had luck on his side too.the batsman was yet to open his account when he dragged the ball onto his stumps but bowler jadeja was found to have over-stepped.this was the third time in the series that jadeja's penchant to bowl no-balls cost him a wicket.labuschagne got another reprieve later when india opted against reviewing an lbw decision against him and replays subsequently confirmed the batter would have been dismissed had they done so.jadeja eventually removed labuschagne just before australia drew level and went on to pick the crucial wickets of khawaja and smith (26)."

75,75,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/stokess-shaky-knee-cloud-englands-ashes-buildup-3314296,Stokes's shaky knee to cloud England's Ashes buildup,"England head home from New Zealand with the rare sting of defeat after the Black Caps' 'Miracle at the Basin' and more than a little concern over the fitness of captain Ben Stokes a few months out from the Ashes.

While Stokes had no regrets about enforcing the follow-on in the one-run defeat in Wellington, he had plenty about the state of his left knee which had him grimacing in pain throughout the drawn two-test series.

Knee trouble has long bothered Stokes but he has soldiered on through 10 test wins in 12 matches since taking charge of England last year.

Things appeared to have come to a head in Wellington, though, where the all-rounder managed to bowl only two overs and was in all sorts of bother when batting despite making 60 runs.

A reliable wicket-taker who often makes things happen with the ball, Stokes' seam bowling was not needed in the first innings as New Zealand were bundled out for 209.

However, England's bowlers might have yearned for their captain's support after he enforced the follow-on and put them in the field again.

New Zealand went on to rack up 483 against them as they tired and set a chase that England fell just short of.

Rather than rest up for the three-and-a-half months before the Ashes, Stokes will be heading to the Indian Premier League (IPL) starting March 31 to fulfil his $2 million deal with the Chennai Super Kings.

Former England captain Michael Vaughan called on Stokes to forgo the IPL to boost his chances of being fully fit for the Ashes which start in Birmingham on June 16.

Stokes wasn't having it.

""I've been working hard with the physios and the medics out here to try to get myself into a place where I can fill that (bowling) role like how I have done the last 10 years or however long it is,"" he said in Wellington.

""I've got a four-month period now to get it, sort of, even better before that Ashes because I want to be turning up in Birmingham being able to fill that role properly.""

England's attacking 'Bazball' revolution under Stokes and head coach Brendon 'Baz' McCullum has breathed new life into test cricket and raised hopes of a classic Ashes contest after Australia dominated the last series 4-0 at home in 2021-22.

Stokes's ability to get through five tests, let alone bowl in them, will be under the microscope.

76,76,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/new-zealand-appoint-fosters-post-world-cup-successor-within-six-weeks-3313991,New Zealand to appoint Foster's post-World Cup successor within six weeks,":New Zealand Rugby (NZR) will appoint a new All Blacks coach within six weeks to succeed Ian Foster after the World Cup, with Foster confirming on Wednesday he will not reapply for the role.

Foster had urged NZR to wait until after the World Cup to decide, however the governing body said ""recent events"" and competition for talent in the global rugby market had forced their hand.

""Following wide ranging consultation and after carefully weighing up all scenarios and the key lessons from 2019, New Zealand Rugby is now commencing a process for selecting the All Blacks Head Coach from 2024,"" NZR Chairwoman Patsy Reddy said in a statement.

""Noting the divergent views as to the best timings for this process and that neither timing window is perfect, out of respect for the people involved, New Zealand Rugby will not be making any further comment after today until a decision has been reached.

""This will be concluded in the next four to six weeks.""

The statement comes three weeks after Scott Robertson, tipped to succeed Foster after the World Cup, said he was expecting an imminent announcement about his future in the New Zealand coaching structure.

Robertson lost out to Foster for the role when Steve Hansen stood down in 2019 but the success he has overseen at the Canterbury Crusaders has earned him plenty of coaching offers in other countries.

Reddy said Foster and the current All Blacks staff continued to have NZR's ""full support"" up to and through the World Cup.

Foster told New Zealand media last week that he might like to continue in the role if the All Blacks won the global showpiece.

On Wednesday, he said he would accept NZR's decision and move on.

""As I said last week, I felt the best thing for our team and for our entire management group was to have this process done after the Rugby World Cup,"" he said in a statement.

""My sole focus remains unchanged. It is to lead this All Blacks team and management group in our planning and preparation so that we go to France with the goal of winning the Rugby World Cup and making this country proud.

""I won't be re-applying for the job.""

Foster was under intense scrutiny last year when the All Blacks suffered three consecutive defeats against Ireland and South Africa but NZR endorsed him as coach through to the World Cup following a review in August.

79,79,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/player-revolts-plunge-womens-world-cup-buildup-turmoil-3313711,Player revolts plunge Women's World Cup buildup into turmoil,"MANCHESTER, England : Player protests and high-level resignations are dominating headlines amid a growing sense of reckoning in women's soccer less than five months before the World Cup kicks off.

Noel Le Graet, president of France's soccer federation (FFF), resigned on Tuesday, while Canada Soccer boss Nick Bontis stepped down a day earlier with those countries' players embroiled in bitter disputes with their federations.

Canada's women's team have vowed to boycott a pre-World Cup camp next month over equal pay and support, while Le Graet faced allegations of harassment. A government ministry audit concluded the 81-year-old Le Graet did not have the ""necessary legitimacy"" for the position.

French women's coach Corinne Diacre is also under fire and her future may be decided on March 9 by an FFF select committee.

Spain has also been rocked by a revolt by 15 players, who withdrew from selection consideration in protest at coach Jorge Vilda.

While the clashes could cast a cloud over the women's global showcase, which begins on July 20th in New Zealand and Australia, players have vowed their fights are far from over, and some say the recent resignations should be just the tip of widespread changes.

""Bontis' departure MUST trigger sweeping change,"" Amy Walsh, who played for Canada at the 2008 Olympics and earned 102 caps, posted on Twitter. ""It's not enough.

""Our athletes - as well as future generations of Canadian footballers - deserve so much better.""

Neither Bontis nor Le Graet, however, are leaving the game. Bontis was named CONCACAF Council vice-president (North America) on Saturday, while Le Graet, who has denied all accusations, has reportedly been pegged to lead FIFA's Paris office.

SUCCESS ON THE PITCH

The turmoil in the two women's programmes is in stark contrast to their success on the pitch. Canada are the reigning Olympic women's champions, while France topped their group in World Cup qualifying.

And while the governance battles rage on, female footballers have forged strong bonds - regardless of what country's colours they wear. When the Canadian women played the recent SheBelieves Cup under protest, they found they had allies in players from around the world.

Both the Americans, who settled an equal pay lawsuit with their federation for $24 million a year ago, and Japanese wore purple tape on their wrists at the SheBelieves Cup, while the U.S. women said in a statement: ""Although we are now on the other side of this fight... our counterparts in Canada and elsewhere are experiencing the same pervasive misogyny and unequal treatment that we faced.""

Across the pond, England's Lionesses wore purple wristbands at the Arnold Clark Cup, to ""display their support (for) the Canadian WNT players and for gender equality,"" the team said in a tweet.

Canada's call for equality goes beyond equal pay. Forward Janine Beckie, who was in Qatar for last year's men's World Cup as part of Canada's broadcast crew, saw the ""disgusting"" discrepancy between the two programmes.

She cited as an example that the Canadian men's team staff was twice the size of the women's.

""I think we've been fighting blindly not knowing what our federation was capable of in terms of support, and then we were all witnesses to what our men's team received,"" said longtime captain Christine Sinclair.

Canadian midfielder Sophie Schmidt told media through tears in Orlando that she nearly quit over shoddy treatment from their federation, but Sinclair and coach Bev Priestman convinced her to reconsider.

France's team captain Wendie Renard said last week she would not play at the World Cup as long as Diacre is in charge.

Fellow French internationals Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Kadidiatou Diani have also said they were taking a step back from the national team.

Spain's 15 players declared themselves unavailable, saying in a statement that playing ""significantly"" affected their ""emotional state.""

The federation replied saying that it wouldn't tolerate any pressure from players.

""I look forward to doing my utmost to help the team achieve success at the upcoming Asian Cup and the 2026 World Cup.""

After retiring as a player in 1998, Klinsmann was Germany's head coach from 2004-06 and led them to a third-place finish at the 2006 World Cup on home soil.

He managed his former club Bayern Munich in the 2008-09 season before becoming head coach of the US national team from 2011 to 2016.

Mbappe, who bagged a double, was set up by Messi for both his goals, and repaid the favour by laying on another for the Argentine forward as PSG, who were without the injured Neymar, moved to 60 points from 25 games with second-placed Marseille on 52.

France forward Mbappe, who was on the losing side against Messi's Argentina in the World Cup final, became PSG's joint record scorer with 200 goals - level with Edinson Cavani - while Messi netted his 700th in club football.

""We were aggressive, we put intensity into the game, that's what we'd been missing,"" said PSG centre back Sergio Ramos.

Marseille coach Igor Tudor said he did not regret his side's high-risk approach.

""Why should we have changed our way of playing? It has been working well this season,"" he said.

""Mbappe's presence didn't change anything. His presence made it more difficult for us to play our game but we were not going to change it.""

Third-placed Monaco slumped to a 3-0 home defeat against Nice, who prevailed thanks to a Terem Moffi double and a superb half-volley by Khephren Thuram.

The result left Monaco on 50 points, ahead of fourth-placed RC Lens on goals scored after the northerners drew 1-1 at Montpellier on Saturday.

PSG, who were knocked out of the French Cup in the last 16 by Marseille earlier this month, ended a three-game losing streak in all competitions by beating Lille last weekend and they were focused throughout at the Velodrome.

They suffered an early injury blow when Presnel Kimpembe, who missed the World Cup for France with an Achilles issue, left the pitch on a stretcher, two weeks after making his comeback from a three-month layoff.

Matteo Guendouzi created danger as Marseille pressed high and hard but they were exposed on the counter and the hosts were punished in the 25th minute when Messi played Mbappe through for the France forward to race into the area and beat Pau Lopez with a low shot.

The roles were reversed four minutes later as Mbappe delivered a pin-point cross for Messi, who tapped in from point-blank range to double the advantage in front of an all-time Ligue 1 record attendance of 65,800.

Messi then missed a sitter and Mbappe was denied by Lopez after being found in the area by the Argentine again, just before Marquinhos's angled shot went just wide as Marseille were again caught on the break.

Messi beautifully lifted the ball into the path of Mbappe, who volleyed home with his left foot for his 16th goal of the season in Ligue 1.

Gianluigi Donnarumma made a spectacular save from Nuno Tavares's header in the 67th to snuff out any hope of a Marseille comeback as PSG secured a first clean sheet in six league games.

England were reduced to 80 for five in pursuit of 258 for the win, with four quick wickets falling at the Basin Reserve, but they went to the break at 168 for five.

Root put the pressure back on the Black Caps with an unbeaten 74 from 74 balls, while an ailing Stokes, battling an apparent knee problem, was 20 not out, the pair having put on 88 runs for the sixth wicket.

New Zealand's attack were a man down, with paceman Matt Henry forced off field with a back problem late in the session.

England resumed on 48 for one in the morning, needing another 210 runs for victory, and were rocked by two wickets in the opening half-hour.

He sent a top-edge high behind the slips, with Michael Bracewell jogging back to take the catch.

Neil Wagner, on the receiving end of some punishing spells from England's batters this series, dismissed Ollie Pope for 14, the number three steering an edge straight to Tom Latham in the slips.

England's man of the moment Harry Brook came to the middle but was run out without facing a ball as Root made a shocking call for a single after pushing a Southee ball to the gully.

Bracewell swooped from the slips and threw to the stumps where wicketkeeper Tom Blundell whipped off the bails with Brook well short of his ground.

New Zealand introduced spin before the drinks break, with Bracewell coming into the attack but the tactic backfired as Root clobbered a six and two fours in successive balls in the all-rounder's first over.

Stokes was lucky at one stage, with Henry finding the shoulder of his bat, but the ball pinged harmlessly off Blundell's gloves.

Manchester City bounced back from two consecutive draws to beat Bournemouth 4-1 over the weekend but Guardiola feels the team can play better as they sit two points behind league leaders Arsenal, who have a game in hand.

The Caribbean side are coming off a 1-0 series win in Zimbabwe earlier this month, but before that were thumped in Australia late last year and will face similar seamer-friendly conditions on their short tour of South Africa.

""It won’t be easy, South Africa are a tough team at home, but we are looking forward to playing some hard days of test cricket,"" Brathwaite told reporters on Monday.

West Indies have lost 12 of their previous 15 tests in South Africa and won just one, though this is the first time they have toured the country in the longest format since 2015. Their only victory was a surprise success in Gqeberha 16 years ago.

Just as they had in Germany three weeks ago when Dortmund won 1-0, 2021 champions Chelsea squandered chance after chance in the first half, with Germany's Havertz hitting the post as well as the side netting.

Portugal loanee Joao Felix and defender Kalidou Koulibaly also went close and Sterling had efforts blocked.

But in the 43rd minute Ben Chilwell crossed into the box and found England team mate Sterling.

Sterling airkicked his first effort, then sidestepped Marco Reus and sent his second high into the net to put the teams level on aggregate.

""It was a massive performance,"" Sterling told BT Sport. ""We had to dig deep. We took our chances. We felt as a team we could do it.""I had a little mis-kick with the first touch but it landed perfectly and allowed us to build on that for our performance.""

Early in the second half a Chilwell cross smacked into the outstretched hand of defender Marius Wolf and Dutch referee Danny Makkelie gave the penalty after being called to the VAR screen.Havertz, taking over as penalty taker from Jorginho who moved to Arsenal in January, hit the keeper's left-hand post to the relief of the visitors.

The game resumed for a few seconds until VAR alerted Makkelie that Dortmund players had encroached into the area.

Havertz retook the kick and sent the ball the same way but this time it squeezed inside the post to put Chelsea ahead in the tie in the 53rd minute.

""I don't know what I was thinking (when it hit the post) but the referee let me retake the penalty,"" Havertz said. ""I was a bit nervous but I scored. I tried to wait and look at the keeper and the second one was a bit easier.""

It was Dortmund's first defeat following wins in their previous 10 matches and a boost for Chelsea, who have struggled for form under Graham Potter since the turn of the year, dropping to 10th place in the Premier League and losing early in their two domestic cups.

A smiling Potter punched the air and applauded the crowd as his team acknowledged the cheers.

""There was a fantastic feeling in the dressing room,"" he said. ""We have been through a tough period and this competition means a lot for us. We wanted to progress and get into the last eight and it sets us up for the next few weeks.""

Led by a tireless Joao Mario, who netted a late penalty, and the in-form Ramos, Benfica showed exactly why they are seen in Portugal as the country's best side since Jose Mourinho's Porto were crowned European champions 19 years ago.

""We have one objective and it's winning every game we play going forward,"" Rafa Silva, who had opened the scoring late in the first half, told Eleven Sports.

Benfica took control from the start as they pressured their rivals in the heavy rain that poured down in Lisbon.

Joao Mario had goal ruled out by VAR in the first minute for an offside in the build-up and Benfica then wasted several clear chances as the visitors looked well out of their depth.

Struggling in the Belgian league, Brugge were coming off an embarrassing 3-0 loss to lowly Oostende at the weekend and are currently languishing fourth in the standings, having now won only two of their last 15 matches in all competitions.

They were outclassed by a well organised Benfica side who remain unbeaten in this season's Champions League and have lost only two competitive games this term, both to Braga and one of those on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the Portuguese Cup.

They are on a seven-game winning streak in the Primeira Liga in which they have scoring 18 goals and conceded one.

It was only a matter of time until they took the lead against Brugge with the goal coming in the 38th minute through Rafa Silva, who dribbled past two defenders and fired a left foot strike into the net after a counter-attack.

Ramos then scored either side of the break, the first coming after a brilliant individual effort in which he dribbled past three players inside the box before slotting the ball home.

In the 57th minute, he extended the lead with a first-time shot from Alex Grimaldo's clever low cross.

Joao Mario scored the fourth from the spot in the 71st after a foul by Abakar Sylla and seven minutes later found substitute David Neres who netted the fifth before Bjorn Meijer struck a brilliant consolation goal for Brugge three minutes from time.

""Things are going well because the team is working hard,"" added Rafa Silva, whose side are top of the Primeira Liga.

The final was delayed by 36 minutes after thousands of Liverpool supporters were unable to get into the Stade de France for the match on May 28, which Real Madrid won 1-0.

French police were filmed using tear gas on fans, including women and children. Although UEFA initially blamed the Merseyside club's fans for the mayhem, the governing body later apologised following the release of an independent review.

""We have taken into account a huge number of views expressed both publicly and privately and we believe we have devised a scheme that is comprehensive and fair,"" UEFA General Secretary Theodore Theodoridis said in statement.

""We value the input from the Liverpool FC supporter organisations Spirit of Shankly (SOS) and Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association (LDSA) as well as the open and transparent dialogue throughout this period.

""We recognise the negative experiences of those supporters on the day and with this scheme we will refund fans who had bought tickets and who were the most affected by the difficulties in accessing the stadium.""

UEFA said refunds would be available to all fans with tickets for gates A, B, C, X, Y and Z which was where ""the most difficult circumstances were reported"". Liverpool fans had 19,618 tickets allocated for the final.

The two fan groups, SOS and LDSA, welcomed the announcement with a joint statement but said it does not let UEFA off the hook.

""With a promise to reimburse supporters, UEFA have gone some way to acknowledge their part in the fiasco,"" they said.

""But it does not excuse UEFA, exempt them from criticism or lessen the need for them to implement all of the recommendations made by the independent inquiry.""

Tickets for the final cost between £62 (US$74) to £610 (US$733).

""In addition, all fans who according to the access control data did not enter the stadium before 21:00 CET (the originally scheduled kick-off time) or who were not able to enter the stadium at all, will be eligible for a refund,"" UEFA added.

""Due to the nature of the original ticket sales process, whereby Liverpool fans purchased tickets from Liverpool FC and not directly from UEFA, UEFA has requested that the club implements the refunds to ensure personal data protection and for ease of process.""

105,105,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/ferrari-put-reliability-top-do-list-3331336,Ferrari put reliability top of the to-do list,"Reliability was not the top concern for new Ferrari boss Fred Vasseur before the start of the Formula One season but Sunday's (Mar 5) opening race in Bahrain sent it back up the list of priorities.

Charles Leclerc, who led a Ferrari one-two from pole at Sakhir last year, lost power and retired 17 laps from the end while Carlos Sainz finished fourth.

Ferrari had already changed the energy store on Leclerc's car before the race, a blow with drivers having only two for the 23-race season without a grid penalty.

Until then both drivers had been more focused on whether their car could match the speed of Red Bull, who suffered a double retirement last year but this time cruised to a one-two finish with Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez.

""Overall I would say the picture is not the one expected before the race,"" Vasseur told reporters.

""It's the first time we had it (the problem) and we didn't face the same issue at all during the 6,000-7,000km that we did with the engines in the last week with the three teams.

""We never had the same issue on the dyno throughout the winter,"" he added.

""The most important now is to have a clear picture of the situation, where we are failing and do a proper analysis on this and to come back stronger as soon as possible.""

The Frenchman felt Ferrari were matching Red Bull in qualifying but needed to fix reliability and tyre degradation in the race.

Both Ferrari drivers suffered heavy tyre wear and while Leclerc was third before the failure, Sainz finished 48 seconds behind Verstappen.

Red Bull dominated on a soft/soft/hard tyre strategy while Ferrari had to go for soft/hard/hard.

""The fact they are able to do two soft and one hard (stints) when we have to do two hard one soft for sure is a game killer,"" said Vasseur.

""We have to improve on this but I would say that the first issue for me is the reliability because we need to have zero issues.""

Vasseur was confident Ferrari were on the right track and could be a match for Red Bull, even if rivals Mercedes are already rethinking their car's design given the gap they face.

""I never saw a car able to match the pace of another one in quali and to not be able to in the race,"" said Vasseur. ""Then it's a matter of set-up and some choices on the car. It's not a matter of concept at all.""

Ferrari won two of the first three races last year before fading due to poor reliability, strategy blunders and driver mistakes.

Vasseur arrived from Swiss-based Sauber in January to replace the departed Mattia Binotto and has made some immediate changes, including a strategy shake-up.

Conte underwent emergency surgery but made a quick return to the dugout last month before doctors advised him to rest and recover again as he watched Spurs games from home while his assistant Cristian Stellini took charge of the team.

The Italian said he wanted to return early after Spurs were knocked out of the FA Cup by Sheffield United last week but he respected the wishes of worried doctors who had put their foot down and asked him to return only on Sunday.

""For sure I under-evaluated the recovery after surgery. For this reason I think that for my sense of responsibility I wanted to come back early,"" Conte told reporters on Tuesday (Mar 7), a day before Milan visit looking to defend their 1-0 lead from the last 16 first leg.

""Maybe I over-evaluated my body and myself. Now I'm well, I've recovered energy and I have to recover weight but for the rest my feeling is good. I try to transfer my energy to my players, it's an important game for us.

""It's important for me to work with my players and the staff and prepare for the games. From afar I tried to stay very close with my players using video. To be present is totally different and for this reason I have to say thanks to my whole staff.""

Spurs forward Son Heung-min said he was glad to have Conte back as his energy was infectious.

""He brings good energy to the team. When the boss isn't here it's different,"" Son said.

""Yesterday we could feel that energy and his passion. If he's on the touchline, the players will be more comfortable and will give us an amazing boost.""

Spurs are fourth in the league and the success of their season could hinge on going through to the next round of the Champions League, with Conte saying they have to cope with ""living with pressure"" and using it in a positive way.

""We live for these moments because when the pressure is going up it means your level is going up,"" Conte said.

""Don't forget that last season we were playing in the Conference League. This season we're playing in the Champions League.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Relevent Sports LLC, a sports promoter controlled by billionaire Miami Dolphins American football team owner Stephen Ross, plausibly alleged that the October 2018 ban unlawfully restricted competition.

""Adoption of the policy, combined with the member leagues' prior agreement, by joining FIFA, to adhere to its policies, constitutes an agreement on the part of all-whether they voted in favor of the policy or not-to adhere to the announced restriction on competition,"" Circuit Judge Raymond Lohier wrote.

The 3-0 decision raises the prospect that U.S. stadiums could eventually host regular season matches between foreign teams, which could compete for fans and sponsors now supporting FIFA-affiliated Major League Soccer.

Some European and South American teams play ""friendly"" matches in the United States, but not regular season matches.

FIFA, soccer's world governing body with 211 member associations, announced its foreign match policy after Relevent arranged with Spain's La Liga to host a regular season match between FC Barcelona and Girona FC in Miami.

Barcelona eventually withdrew, and Relevent sued after U.S. Soccer refused to sanction a May 2019 match in Miami between two Ecuadorean teams.

Relevent, based in New York, also operates the International Champions Cup.

In July 2021, U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni found no proof of an illegal conspiracy to ban foreign matches.

She also said U.S. Soccer had good reasons to honor the ban, including the risk FIFA might exclude U.S. men from the World Cup.

Tuesday's decision overturned that ruling, and returned the case to Caproni.

FIFA said it will review the decision. U.S. Soccer and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In an email, Relevent's lawyer Jeffrey Kessler said the company looked forward to pursuing its claims ""to vindicate the ability of U.S. soccer fans to enjoy live play of some of the best soccer teams in the world.""

After rank turners were rolled out for the first three matches of the series, curiosity abounded about the possible nature of the surface in Ahmedabad.

With the groundstaff yet to confirm which of the two prepared pitches would be used, Australia's stand-in captain Steve Smith decided to delay naming their playing XI.

""We'll have a look (at the pitch on Wednesday) and we'll reassess, but it could be we name the team at the toss,"" Smith told reporters on Wednesday.

Smith will lead Australia again in the absence of regular skipper Pat Cummins who flew home after the second match in Delhi to be with his ailing mother in Sydney.

India retained the Border-Gavaskar trophy with back-to-back wins in Nagpur and Delhi but Smith says drawing the series would be no mean feat for his side.

""It'd be a huge achievement for the group, or any touring team that comes here to India and wins two test matches,"" Smith said.

The largest attendance for a single day of test cricket is 91,112 - a record set during the fourth game between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the 2013-14 Ashes series.

That could be shattered on Thursday when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after whom the 132,000 capacity stadium in Ahmedabad is named, welcomes his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese.

India, who are 2-1 ahead in the series, would need to win the match to seal their place in the final of the World Test Championship in June against Australia.

Skipper Rohit Sharma played down pitch talks and said the team with better skills would prevail.

""How challenging the pitches are, how much is it turning, how much is it seaming...we are trying to keep all of that away,"" Rohit told reporters.

""Conditions are there for us to play and you got to find your ways to score your runs on whatever pitches you play on.""

Spinners have ruled the roost in the series, especially in the third test in Indore where India suffered two collapses en route to a nine-wicket loss.

Djokovic, one of the most high-profile athletes unvaccinated against the virus, applied to the U.S. government last month for special permission to play at ATP Masters events Indian Wells, which begins on Wednesday, and the March 19-April 2 Miami Open.

The Serbian, 35, formally withdrew from Indian Wells on Sunday. Florida Senator Rick Scott said that U.S. officials had denied Djokovic's request.

""This denial is unfair, unscientific and unacceptable,"" DeSantis wrote in a letter to Biden on Tuesday.

""I urge you to reconsider. It's time to put pandemic politics aside and give the American people what they want - let him play.""

Republican DeSantis signed a law in November 2021 banning schools, businesses and government entities from requiring vaccination against COVID-19, drawing condemnation from health experts and Democratic leaders.

The U.S. currently bars unvaccinated foreigners from entry into the country, a policy that is expected to be lifted when the government ends its COVID-19 emergency declarations on May 11.

Djokovic, who missed last year's Australian Open after being deported from that country due to his vaccination status, has said he would skip Grand Slams rather than have a COVID shot.

He won his record-tying 22nd Grand Slam at the Australian Open in January. He has not played at Indian Wells or the Miami Open - which together comprise the ""Sunshine Double"" - since 2019.

Last week, Scott and fellow Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida also wrote to Biden urging him to grant the waiver request.

Indian Wells tournament director Tommy Haas, the United States Tennis Association and the U.S. Open were among those also hoping Djokovic would be allowed to enter.

Wales players had threatened not to play against England last month to protest contract and other issues, but the strike was averted and the game went ahead as scheduled, with Wales suffering their third successive defeat at the tournament.

Wales remain at the bottom of the Six Nations standings without a point. They play away against Italy on Saturday.

""It is just unfortunate, and the situation we are all in at the moment is not great for anyone involved,"" number eight Faletau told British media on Tuesday. ""It's just a tough time we are stuck in at the moment.""

Welsh rugby remains challenged by financial problems as a deal between the governing WRU, Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets has yet to be agreed upon.

Those professional regions are facing major funding cuts that could lead to heavily-reduced contract offers for many players whose deals expire at the end of the season, while an exodus of players to clubs abroad is also a possibility.

A full-fledged WPL kicked off on Saturday, 15 years after the launch of the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) for men, and Healy leads UP Warriorz in the five-team tournament.

The WPL is expected to be a game changer for the women's game after several female cricketers experienced the biggest payday of their careers at the auction, where teams had $1.45 million each to spend on acquiring players.

Reflecting Australia's dominance in women's cricket, Healy said the WBBL, an eight-team competition in Australia, would need to ensure it is lucrative enough to attract the best players.

""The WBBL has been the envy of women's cricket for eight years now, but there's no denying the WPL will put pressure on our domestic competition,"" Healy wrote in her column on Cricket Australia's website on Wednesday.

""It's not all about money, but players in the WPL are earning more for a three-week competition than they are playing for their country for 12 months of the year.

""For the WBBL to keep pace with the WPL and retain its status as the best domestic competition in the world, we need to make sure it's lucrative and exciting enough for the best players to keep making the trip to Australia.""

Healy added that Australia needed to start considering franchise cricket as an ""entertainment proposition"".

Former Germany coach Klinsmann, 58, has signed a contract until the 2026 World Cup and succeeds Paulo Bento, who stepped down in December after South Korea's World Cup round of 16 defeat by Brazil in Qatar.

South Korea were the inaugural Asian Cup champions in 1956 and last won the competition when they retained the trophy as hosts in 1960. They have already qualified for the 2023 tournament in Qatar, which has been delayed until January.

""Our goal is to win the Asian Cup next year,"" Klinsmann told reporters, reeling off the names of previous South Korea coaches and their recent successes.

""When you have a team and a history for the last 20-25 years here that was built by coaches like Guus Hiddink, Uli Stielike, Paulo Bento, I think the goal has to be winning the Asian Cup,"" he said.

Dutch coach Hiddink led South Korea to the 2002 World Cup semi-finals. In December under Portuguese coach Bento, they stunned Portugal en route to reaching the final 16. South Korea also dumped former champions Germany out of the group stages in the 2018 World Cup.

""Winning is the goal because you proved in Qatar and you beat big nations, you beat Portugal in Qatar and four years ago you beat Germany so you can do very well,"" Klinsmann said.

""When this opportunity came up and we had to talk, I was very excited because I think it's a very good team.""

Klinsmann, who was announced as Bento's replacement last month, won the 1990 World Cup as a player and coached his native Germany to the semi-finals of the 2006 tournament.

He also managed his former club Bayern Munich before taking over as head coach of the U.S. national team from 2011-16. His last coaching role was a 10-week stint in charge of Bundesliga side Hertha Berlin in 2020.

The Hurricanes skipper drew his thumb across his throat as he exchanged words with Melbourne Rebels scrumhalf Ryan Louwrens during their Super Rugby match last weekend.

Loose forward Savea was sanctioned by a judicial panel on Tuesday for going ""against the spirit of good sportsmanship"".

""He accepted it pretty much straight away. When he was sitting in the sin bin for 10 minutes (he knew) it was something he shouldn’t have done,"" Hurricanes coach Jason Holland told New Zealand media.

""I’m aligned with him on that and to get the one-week sanction is the way it is and we accept it.

""Ardie was sorry and we just have to get on with accepting that and get on with what comes next.""

Savea's loss is a big blow for the undefeated Hurricanes who host last year's runnersup, the Auckland Blues, at home on Saturday.

Savea was instrumental in the 39-33 win over the Rebels in Melbourne, scoring two tries and setting up another for Josh Moorby before he was yellow-carded for his involvement in a melee.

Holland said he was not sure what led to Savea making the threatening gesture at Louwrens as he walked off to the sin bin.

""I don’t think there was any one thing - it was just a combination of how everything unfolded there with people running in from both sides and a bit of adrenaline going but as we’ve said, there’s no excuse for where we got to at the end of it,"" added Holland.

Dortmund won the first leg at home 1-0 but a first-half goal by Raheem Sterling and a controversial penalty by Havertz handed them a 2-0 defeat in the second leg at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday as they crashed out of the last 16 2-1 on aggregate.

Chelsea were given a penalty in the second half after a cross from Ben Chilwell smacked into the outstretched hand of Dortmund defender Marius Wolf.

Havertz hit the post from the spot but the penalty was re-taken after VAR alerted the referee that Dortmund players had encroached into the area. In his second try, Havertz went on to score, sending Chelsea into the quarter-finals.

""I'm not sure what more he can do with his hand,"" Bellingham told BT Sport, referring to Wolf. ""That in itself was disappointing and the fact that they've had a retake, I think it's a joke.

""For every penalty, especially when you have such a slow run-up, there's going to be people encroaching into the box by a yard or so. He has made the decision and we have to live with it.""

Hamilton had been considered the frontrunner and preferred candidate to stage the centennial Games but was unable to obtain the required government backing by Commonwealth Sport Canada's February deadline.

The Hamilton100 bid proposed an operating budget of around C$1 billion CDN ($727 million), with the private sector kicking in between $250 million to $500 million.

""Commonwealth Sport Canada set an early deadline for provincial financial support and the province simply didn’t have sufficient time to make a commitment,"" Hamilton100 bid chief Louis Frapporti told Reuters on Tuesday.

""As a consequence Commonwealth Sport Canada jumped to Alberta, where they were prepared to make an early commitment to support the funding of bid preparation.

116,116,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/im-still-here-says-potter-after-chelsea-beat-dortmund-3332766,"'I'm still here,' says Potter after Chelsea beat Dortmund","LONDON : Chelsea boss Graham Potter looked like the most relieved man in London as he punched the air and blew kisses into the crowd after his struggling side's 2-1 aggregate win over Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday.

Chelsea fans, many of whom had booed Potter loudly when defeat followed defeat in recent weeks, cheered the team off the pitch after a goal by Raheem Sterling and a re-taken penalty by Kai Havertz earned the Blues a 2-0 win on the night.

That turned a 1-0 deficit in the first leg in Germany into a ticket for the quarter finals and kicked off celebrations that harked back to some of Chelsea's great nights in Europe's top competition over the past 20 years.

For Potter, the victory was personal too.

""Inevitably in life, you are going to have bad times and you're going to have good times,"" Potter told reporters when asked about how he felt after shouldering much of the blame for Chelsea's bleak run of form that began as far back as October.

""Things are never bad forever, thankfully. But it felt like that sometimes,"" he said.

Potter confirmed he had a quick post-match meeting with Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly who had been all smiles in the stands, wrapped in a blue and white scarf.

""I'm still here,"" Potter said about the outcome of the meeting, shrugging off with a laugh the speculation that his job was on the line depending on the result of Tuesday's match.

It was the biggest win yet for Chelsea's new owners who paid 4.25 billion pounds ($5.03 billion) last year for the 2021 European champions.

Since then, the consortium has invested more than 500 million pounds in new players, continuing the kind of lavish spending seen under the former owner of Stamford Bridge, Russian tycoon Roman Abramovich, who was forced to relinquish the club after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.

Until Tuesday's win, Boehly and the rest of the consortium had seen little return on their investment.

Chelsea have slumped to 10th place in the English Premier League, with their chances of reaching next season's Champions League via a top-four finish all but gone, and the team were eliminated early in both of England's knockout cup competitions.

The Blues struggled even to score during a miserable run of two wins in 15 games that was only ended last Saturday with a close-run 1-0 victory over struggling Leeds United.

Potter, who had to fill the big shoes of Champions League winner Thomas Tuchel when the German was fired last September, again told reporters after Tuesday's win that his job had been made harder by a long list of injuries in late 2022.

But the former Brighton & Hove Albion coach went out of his way to praise Chelsea fans, saying he understood their frustrations and appreciated the atmosphere they created in Stamford Bridge against Dortmund.

""Big thanks to the supporters. They were amazing tonight, they helped us on Saturday and they helped us this evening,"" Potter said. ""So it's brilliant for everyone connected with the club.""

The 41-year-old former Norway international said that she did not want to be appointed to the highest committee of European soccer's governing body, known as ExCo, and instead is aiming to break new ground by being elected by the other national associations.

""I'm the first female president to ever run for an ExCo election, which is pretty critical when you consider that it's the biggest sport for girls and women in the world, so we need a board that reflects that,"" she said in a telephone interview.

Part of the Norway team that finished fourth at the World Cup in China in 2007, Klaveness played 73 times for her country and served as Norway's technical director before being elected NFF president a year ago.

""Men's football is just as close to my heart as women's football, I find that technical competence has to be represented in the boardrooms, alongside business skills and entertainment skills and investment skills, but the technical aspect needs to be very well-represented, and I'm ready to do that,"" she said.

Having climbed to the highest post in her country's football association, Klaveness is looking for broader female representation across the board.

""I am for a system where you're elected because of merit, so the reason why I talk about female representation is that I think it's a very important thing for football structures,"" she explained when asked why other nations should vote for her.

GOOD INSIGHT

""I will be ready to do a good job in the ExCo because I have good insight to the game - I've spent my life in football, both on the women's and the men's side,"" she said.

""I was the first female to ever commentate on the men's game in Norway, on the World Cup and Premier League, and then the first technical director to lead the men's national team, and now the first female president.""

A qualified lawyer specialising in employment law, Klaveness gave a fiery speech at FIFA's congress in Doha in March last year, urging delegates to consider the situation of migrant workers and LGBT people ahead of the World Cup in Qatar, which took place in November and December.

While she says she has seen progress in football in terms of equality over the last two decades, the former midfielder said there is still work to be done.

""I definitely see the progress and it inspires me, but it does not change that, on some level, it's going the opposite direction - for example, gaps increasing between bonus payments between the men and women,"" she said.

The elections to UEFA's executive committee will take place at the governing body's congress in early April, and Klaveness is hoping that its members will be ready to give their votes to a female candidate.

""I think it's time, and it's an important step ... I think that, if we want diversity down the (football) pyramid, we need to walk the walk at the top level,"" she said.

The Olympic bronze medallist has already qualified for the World Athletics Championships in August and the renewal of the Ukraine Solidarity Fund, announced by the sport's global governing body on Wednesday, will help ease her road there.

The World Athletics backed fund distributed $220,000 to more than 100 Ukraine athletes in 2022.

Ryzhykova fled her eastern Ukraine home of Dnipro within weeks of Russia invading the country in February last year in what Moscow calls a ""special operation."" Her coach Volodymyr Kravchenko joined Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces.

""Every Ukrainian stood up to defend our homeland ... as is the case in sport,"" Ryzhykova told a small group of reporters on a call from Fort Worth, Texas, where she is temporarily living and training. ""By participating in competitions, we do not let the world forget about such a country as Ukraine.

""I continue to cry and worry every day about my friends, my family. But I still continue to train and still continue to show good results to help my country.""

The 33-year-old Ryzhykova was fifth in the 400 metres hurdles at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and won bronze at the 2012 London Olympics in the 4x400 relay.

FACILITIES DESTROYED

According to international athlete-led organisation Global Athlete, since the invasion 343 sport facilities have been destroyed, leaving an estimated 140,000 young athletes without facilities, while 40,000 athletes are training abroad.

The figures cover all sports.

Ryzhykova spent many weeks each year training at a top athletics facility in Bakhmut.

Russian forces have been waging an intense campaign for months to seize control of the small city and secure Moscow its first battlefield victory in more than half a year.

""Now it is destroyed, and the city is under fire for the last many months,"" said Ryzhykova.

The financial help to train and compete abroad is crucial since ""sports bases have been destroyed, there are constant threats of rocket attacks, we live in fear,"" she added.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last month that 228 Ukrainian athletes had been killed in the war.

RUSSIAN STRIKE

Ukraine's high jumper Kateryna Tabashnyk dedicated her bronze medal at this month's European Indoor Championships to her mother, who was killed in a Russian strike in August, saying: ""This medal carries all my pain and sorrow.""

World Athletics announced it was renewing the Ukraine Solidarity Fund, plus several steps planned towards achieving gender equity as part of its #WeGrowAthletics campaign in celebration of Wednesday's International Women's Day.

World Athletics distributed over $220,000 to more than 100 Ukrainian athletes in 2022. Female athletes, including hurdler Anna Ryzhykova, comprised 70 per cent of fund beneficiaries.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year in what Moscow calls a ""special operation"" since when 343 sport facilities have been destroyed, leaving an estimated 140,000 young athletes without facilities, while 40,000 athletes are training abroad.

The international athlete-led organisation Global Athlete provided the figures which cover all sports in Ukraine.

""I hope no one ever feels this despair,"" said Ryzhykova, who was fifth in the 400 metres hurdles at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and won Olympic bronze in the 4x400 relay in 2012 in London.

""You forget about your career, about your dreams and you think about how to survive and how to help your family and friends to survive, and the World Athletics Solidarity Fund really saved our athletes' careers, and gave us a chance to fight for our country in our own way.""

Ryzhykova is a member of World Athletics' athletes commission and has pledged to run for a WA administrative position in the future.

Among its steps toward gender equity, World Athletics is set to have 40 per cent female participation and at least one female vice-president on the World Athletics Council this year.

It is targeting 40 per cent female participation in online courses as part of a learning pipeline for future administrators.

World Athletics also plans to expand research into representation of female athletes across media channels.

And it has set a deadline of the end of 2023 for all 214 global member federations to implement safeguarding policies.

World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said gender equity was an important part of reforms introduced in 2016.

""In today's world, it is not enough to provide equal opportunity, we must provide equity,"" he said in a statement.

120,120,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/arsenal-thrash-everton-go-five-points-clear-3316926,Arsenal thrash Everton to go five points clear,"LONDON: Arsenal opened up a five-point lead at the top of the Premier League as Gabriel Martinelli struck twice in a 4-0 thrashing of relegation-threatened Everton at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday (Mar 1).

The hosts were initially frustrated by their struggling visitors but goals by Bukayo Saka and Martinelli shortly before halftime put them in command as they took maximum advantage of their game in hand over Manchester City.

Captain Martin Odegaard made it 3-0 with a close-range finish in the 71st minute before Brazilian Martinelli grabbed his second to complete the rout.

A third victory in succession since losing at home to City lifted Mikel Arteta's side to 60 points from 25 games with champions City on 55.

Everton, who now have only one victory from their last 27 league visits to Arsenal, had actually looked capable of taking something from the game. But once they fell behind a 14th league defeat of the season was almost a formality.

They remained third from bottom with 21 points having played a game more than all the teams around them.

While Everton are haunted by the looming prospect of a first relegation from the Premier League, Arsenal are beginning to envisage a first title since 2004, although they still have to visit Manchester City in April.

""I am delighted with the win and the way we played after the first 25 minutes. We had some difficulties at the start,"" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said.

""Once we scored the first goal, the game unlocked. We needed a magic moment and Bukayo produced that. After that we grew and deserved to win the game.

""We played really well in the second half and could have scored more.""

Everton stunned Arsenal 1-0 in Sean Dyche's first game in charge in early February and for 40 minutes they did an extremely effective job at nullifying them again.

But with halftime looming they caved in.

Dangerman Saka had been relatively quiet but he burst into life to make the breakthrough.

Given far too much time to turn after receiving a pass from Odegaard on the right edge of the penalty area, he smashed an angled shot into the roof of the net.

Everton's Idrissa Gueye gifted Arsenal a second on the stroke of halftime. The Senegalese midfielder was caught napping by Saka who nicked the ball away from him before poking a pass to Martinelli who slipped his shot past Jordan Pickford.

The visitors thought they had been spared by an offside flag but a VAR decision overturned it and Arsenal went in at halftime to chants of ""we are top of the league"" from the home fans.

With only 17 league goals all season it looked a tall order for shot-shy Everton to salvage anything and they offered next to nothing after the break.

Liverpool climbed into sixth spot in the table on 39 points, ahead of Fulham on goal difference and with a game in hand, but the home side were forced to work hard on a rainy night at Anfield.

""We controlled the game without creating massively, but we found our rhythm back,"" Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp said in a TV interview as his side claimed their third win in an unbeaten four-game Premier League run.

Despite fashioning the first effort on goal in the game, the visitors suffered an early blow when left back Hugo Bueno went down clutching his hamstring midway through the first half and was replaced by Rayan Ait-Nouri.

The best chances of the opening 45 minutes fell to teenaged Liverpool midfielder Harvey Elliott, who steered a header just wide in the 39th minute and followed that up with a bouncing stoppage-time shot that was turned away for a corner.

The 19-year-old was in the thick of things again 10 minutes into the second half, controlling a firm pass from Darwin Nunez and firing another shot goalwards, but again it lacked the necessary power and precision and was easily saved by Jose Sa.

Nunez had the ball in the net for the home side in the 66th minute after a surging run by Diogo Jota, but the Portuguese striker was deemed to have fouled Max Kilman in the build-up after a VAR review and the goal was chalked off.

Van Dijk finally broke the deadlock in the 73rd minute, forcing a save with his initial header from a set-piece, before Jota put the rebound back across the goal for the Dutchman to head home from close range.

Four minutes later Salah used his right thigh to steer home a cross from Kostas Tsimikas to double his side's advantage and take the wind out of the visitors' sails as Liverpool cruised to victory, much to the delight of the home fans.

""You have to break an opponent down step by step, it's not often they make mistakes and you get easy goals in the 420 or something games I've had here,"" Klopp said.

His side now face a resurgent Manchester United, who are 10 points ahead of Liverpool in third spot, on Sunday.

The 22-times Grand Slam champion was in no mood to waste any more time after a couple of short delays due to light rain as he attacked his Dutch opponent's serve early in the next set.

Firing winners at will from the baseline, the Serbian also showed soft hands with a vintage drop shot and followed it up with a stunning pass at the net before surging to a 4-0 lead.

Griekspoor managed to win a game and world number one Djokovic dropped serve with a double fault before sealing victory in style.

""It's been a great evening for me. Yesterday, I really had to work hard to get a win,"" Djokovic said.

""Tonight, right from the beginning I was sharp. I played better quality tennis. Maybe the last three or four games were not the best to close the match but I managed to find the good serve in the end.

""I'm very pleased ... with the way I felt on the court and hopefully things can go in the right direction for tomorrow.""

The Serbian will next face either Pavel Kotov or Hubert Hurkacz.

The sweeping changes, which were outlined in a letter sent to PGA Tour members by Commissioner Jay Monahan, do not apply to all elevated events as the four majors, The Players Championship and three FedExCup playoff events will be unaffected.

""These smaller, designated event fields will not only deliver substantial, can't-miss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season, but they will also enhance the quality of full-field events,"" wrote Monahan.

""Together, this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive, compelling, consequential and with clarity for fans, players and sponsors alike.""

According to the memo, select designated events in 2024 will feature limited fields of between 70 to 80 players with no cuts taking place after 36 holes and with opportunities for in-form players from full-field events to qualify and compete.

By comparison, last month's Phoenix Open, which was the PGA Tour's first fully-fledged designated event, had a field of 136 golfers that was cut to 66 after the second round.

Designated events were announced by the PGA Tour last August to get the best players competing against each other more often. The move came amid the threat posed by LIV Golf, which features limited-field, 54-hole events with no cuts and guaranteed prize money for each golfer.

""Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Congratulations PGA Tour. Welcome to the future,"" read a message posted on LIV Golf's Twitter account on Wednesday as news of the PGA Tour's designated event changes circulated online.

""FAIR SHAKE""

Starting next year, designated events will include the top 50 players from the previous year's FedExCup regular season list along with the top 10 players not otherwise eligible from the current points list.

Other qualification criteria include performance in non-designated events, consideration of the world rankings and sponsor exemptions for some PGA Tour members.

World number three Rory McIlroy, speaking to reporters ahead of this week's Arnold Palmer Invitational, said the changes will make the PGA Tour more competitive.

""I'm all about rewarding good play. ... I want to give everyone a fair shake at this. Which I think this structure has done. There's ways to play into it,"" McIlroy, who also holds a position on the PGA Tour's Player Advisory Council, said at Bay Hill in Orlando, Florida.

""It's trying to get the top guys versus the hot guys, right? I think that creates a really compelling product. But a way that you don't have to wait an entire year for your good play to then get the opportunity. That opportunity presents itself straight away.""

Max Homa, ranked eighth in the world and also a member of the Player Advisory Council, acknowledged the emergence of LIV Golf, which has lured many big names from the PGA Tour, may have forced the U.S.-based circuit to rethink things.

""One of the things that they have that's great that this will provide now is a guaranteed product. You know who is going to be at each event,"" said Homa.

Russian athletes have been banned from many sports and largely cannot compete in Europe due to the sanctions and competition complications caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb 24, 2022.

However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) last month urged sports federations to create a pathway for Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to international competitions in Asia.

This pathway would also give those athletes the chance to qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympics through Asian qualifying events as they are unable to compete in Europe.

Belarus is also under Western sanctions because it has allowed Russia to use its territory as a key staging area for the invasion.

""This day witnessed a historic event: A chess federation, one of the strongest in the world, has moved from one continent to another for the first time ever,"" Russian chess federation president Andrey Filatov said on Tuesday (Feb 28) following the ACF vote in Abu Dhabi.

125,125,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/just-fontaine-world-cup-record-scorer-dies-3315191,World Cup finals record goal-scorer Just Fontaine dies,"PARIS: Just Fontaine, the all-time top scorer in a single World Cup finals with 13 goals, has died aged 89, his family told AFP on Wednesday (Mar 1).

Fontaine achieved the record during the 1958 finals in Sweden, where France reached the semi-finals for the first time in their history.

To this day, only three players have scored more World Cup goals than Fontaine, even though the Reims player appeared at just one tournament and played only six matches.

Lionel Messi matched his tally on Argentina's recent run to glory in Qatar, but it took him five World Cups to get there.

That 1958 World Cup in Sweden is best remembered as the coming of age of a 17-year-old Pele, who inspired Brazil to victory after netting a hat-trick in their 5-2 semi-final win over France.

However, it was a personal triumph for Fontaine, whose four-goal haul in the third-place playoff win over West Germany ensured that he had scored in every game.

Part of a wonderful attacking trident alongside Roger Piantoni and Raymond Kopa, Fontaine might never have gone to Sweden at all.

Only injuries to Thadee Cisowski and his Reims teammate Rene Bliard saw him make the squad and then the starting line-up.

""It was only at the airport before leaving for Sweden that Paul Nicolas (part of the national team staff) and Albert Batteux (the France coach), who didn't really want me, told me I would be playing as centre-forward,"" Fontaine told AFP in 2013.

Only Germany's Miroslav Klose (16), Brazil's Ronaldo (15) and Gerd Muller, the West German hero of the 1970s who scored 14 times, have netted more World Cup finals goals.

Just two other players - Muller with 10 in 1970 and Hungary's Sandor Kocsis with 11 in 1954 - have reached double figures at a single World Cup.

Yet, Kopa is remembered as the biggest French star of the era. When he died in 2017, Fontaine remembered fondly his ""big brother"".

""Raymond had character,"" he said. ""So did I, and that made us a magical duo.""

Born in Marrakech in August 1933 to a French father and Spanish mother at the time of the French Protectorate in Morocco, Fontaine went to school in Casablanca, and began his football career there.",[],,"paris: just fontaine, the all-time top scorer in a single world cup finals with 13 goals, has died aged 89, his family told afp on wednesday (mar 1).fontaine achieved the record during the 1958 finals in sweden, where france reached the semi-finals for the first time in their history.to this day, only three players have scored more world cup goals than fontaine, even though the reims player appeared at just one tournament and played only six matches.lionel messi matched his tally on argentina's recent run to glory in qatar, but it took him five world cups to get there.that 1958 world cup in sweden is best remembered as the coming of age of a 17-year-old pele, who inspired brazil to victory after netting a hat-trick in their 5-2 semi-final win over france.however, it was a personal triumph for fontaine, whose four-goal haul in the third-place playoff win over west germany ensured that he had scored in every game.part of a wonderful attacking trident alongside roger piantoni and raymond kopa, fontaine might never have gone to sweden at all.only injuries to thadee cisowski and his reims teammate rene bliard saw him make the squad and then the starting line-up.""it was only at the airport before leaving for sweden that paul nicolas (part of the national team staff) and albert batteux (the france coach), who didn't really want me, told me i would be playing as centre-forward,"" fontaine told afp in 2013.only germany's miroslav klose (16), brazil's ronaldo (15) and gerd muller, the west german hero of the 1970s who scored 14 times, have netted more world cup finals goals.just two other players - muller with 10 in 1970 and hungary's sandor kocsis with 11 in 1954 - have reached double figures at a single world cup.yet, kopa is remembered as the biggest french star of the era. when he died in 2017, fontaine remembered fondly his ""big brother"".""raymond had character,"" he said.

South Africa limped to 49 for four in their second innings having been all out for 342 in their first early on the second morning.

They dismissed West Indies for 212 in reply as seamer Gerald Coetzee also claimed figures of 2-45 on debut, with 24 wickets already lost in six sessions in the match.

Dean Elgar (1), debutant Tony de Zorzi (0), Keegan Petersen (7) and Temba Bavuma (0), with a pair of ducks, are all already dismissed for the home side in their second innings.

Bavuma is the fourth player to get a pair on their test captaincy debut after Mark Taylor, Rashid Latif and Habibul Bashar.

First innings centurion Aiden Markram (35 not out) and Heinrich Klaasen (0 not out) will resume on the third morning, hoping to build on what is already a sizeable advantage.

Seamer Alzarri Joseph (2-17) has impressed again after he claimed a maiden test five-wicket haul in South Africa's first innings with 5-81.

""It's not the quickest wicket, it's going a little up and down, but we are just sticking to our plans,"" Nortje said. ""I need to adjust a little now and then. It's just about finding that rhythm.

""We need some sort of partnership to take the lead to 250-plus. Definitely that's very competitive. The more we can get the better, but I would think 250-plus is a very good score.""

West Indies made a strong start to their first innings but lost their final seven wickets for 43 runs as Nortje proved chief destroyer.

Kagiso Rabada (2-44) claimed the first wicket with a beautiful delivery that angled into captain Kraigg Brathwaite (11) and then seamed away off the pitch and hit the top of off-stump.

Tagenarine Chanderpaul (22), son of West Indies great Shivnarine, was caught by Senuran Muthusamy at gully to give Coetzee his first test wicket.

The visitors showed some dogged determination in the face of hostile home bowling and Blackwood reached 37 before an inside edge off Nortje was caught by diving wicketkeeper Klaasen.

The Brumbies dominated their Australian rivals last year but fell short in a 20-19 thriller at Eden Park as the Blues booked their place in the final against the eventual champion Canterbury Crusaders.

The Blues have won their last 14 regular season matches, including last week's 60-20 hiding of the Otago Highlanders in their season-opener in Dunedin.

The Brumbies, however, have proved tough foes for the Blues and head into Sunday's afternoon clash at the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium confident after a solid 31-25 win over the improving New South Wales Waratahs.

""We know the Brumbies will bring a physical, confronting game and we have been preparing all week to meet that challenge,"" Blues captain Dalton Papalii said.

All matches will be played at the Rectangular Stadium in three consecutive days of double-headers as part of the competition's ""Super Round"".

The Crusaders, who face the Otago Highlanders on Friday, might welcome the chance to play in a city where rugby is barely on the radar given the media storm over the All Blacks' coaching situation back home.

Within six weeks, Crusaders' coach Scott Robertson is expected to be confirmed as Ian Foster's successor as All Blacks coach after the World Cup in France, regardless of the application process announced by New Zealand Rugby (NZR) on Wednesday.

The Crusaders were upset 31-10 by the Waikato Chiefs in a major shock at home last weekend, and Robertson will not want another defeat on his ledger before interviews with NZR.

He will have veteran All Blacks lock Sam Whitelock back in the side fore the Highlanders clash and has restored the formidable midfield partnership of David Havili and Jack Goodhue after using Havili at fullback last week.

The Wellington Hurricanes will look to back up their impressive 47-13 win away to the Queensland Reds when they meet the home team, Melbourne Rebels, on Friday.

Hurricanes winger Julian Savea scored his 58th try against the Reds and can match Israel Folau's all-time Super Rugby record with a double against the Rebels.

The Waratahs experimented with dual opensides in their back row against the Brumbies but ditched that after one match, dropping Charlie Gamble to the bench for their match against Fijian Drua on Saturday.

The Western Force, meanwhile, have promoted comeback king Jeremy Thrush to their starting lineup for Sunday's match against the Reds after the 37-year-old lock scored the winning try off the bench against the Rebels last week.

Thrush retired in the off-season but was coaxed back to the game after an injury to Izack Rodda.

A knee issue has long bothered Stokes and he has come under pressure in some quarters to rest the joint and skip his lucrative stint in the IPL with the Chennai Super Kings from the end of the month.

McCullum, however, said the all-rounder had built a career on peaking in big moments and the Ashes series against Australia in June and July would be no different.

""I ... believe that the Ashes is the script that the skipper is waiting to write, so he'll be sweet. I don't have any concerns,"" he told reporters in Wellington at the conclusion of the drawn series with New Zealand.

""I don't think he's jeopardising it. I know that Chennai set-up, I played for that franchise, and it is excellent in looking after the players.

""He knows how to get right for the big moments. His life is that, right? When he comes back into the fold and leads us into the Ashes campaign, he'll have the bit between his teeth and I think we'll be all right.""

Stokes has already said he will leave the IPL early to prepare for a one-off test against Ireland at Lord's on June 1 and the first Ashes test at Edgbaston, which starts on Jun 16.

McCullum and Stokes have led England to 10 wins in 12 tests since taking over early last year on the back of an entertaining style of play dubbed ""Bazball"" after the coach's nickname.

The second defeat came in the most dramatic of circumstances on Tuesday when New Zealand triumphed by a single run to become only the fourth team to win a test after being asked to follow on.

McCullum, like Stokes, was unapologetic for the decision to enforce the follow on and said there was unlikely to be much change to the way England approached the game.

""I think there'll be tens of millions of people around the world that sat back and enjoyed that test match,"" he added.

With 4,000 fans making the long journey from the Humber Estuary to the Solent, many wielding inflatable haddocks, Grimsby belied their lowly status with a deserved win.

Two penalties netted by Gavan Holohan either side of halftime sealed a 2-1 victory on one of the biggest nights in Grimsby's history and their reward is a trip to top-flight Brighton and Hove Albion in the last eight - a clash destined to be billed as the Seagulls versus Haddocks.

Manager Paul Hurst described it as a 'miracle' as his side became only the sixth team from the fourth tier or below to reach the last eight of the FA Cup Cup since the introduction of the division in 1958-59.

""I'm in shock a little bit. Just delighted for the players. What an effort. We kept disciplined. Look at what that means to the support,"" Hurst said as the visiting fans celebrated loudly.

Grimsby's hearts were in their mouths as Duje Caleta-Car gave Southampton a lifeline and then Theo Walcott appeared to have equalised with 10 minutes to go, only for his effort to be chalked off by VAR for offside.

Grimsby's win means they are the first team in the competition's history to eliminate five different teams from a higher division in one season.

Three days after they won the League Cup, Manchester United trailed to Said Benrahma's 54th-minute goal at Old Trafford but an own goal by West Ham's Nayef Aguerd and late strikes from Alejandro Garnacho and Fred sent the hosts into the last eight.

Manchester manager Erik Ten Hag was delighted with his players.

""The resilience from this team and the belief they're going to win it was magnificent,"" the Dutchman told ITV.

West Ham, who have won only once at Old Trafford in their last 22 visits, took advantage of sloppy defending to open the scoring.

Tomas Soucek kept the ball in play on the left touchline and as Manchester United players appealed for a throw-in, the Czech played the ball to Benrahma who fired a shot past David De Gea into the top corner.

United thought they had equalised when Bruno Fernandes found Casemiro with a pin-point free kick, but his headed effort was disallowed for offside.

The game looked set for extra time until Argentine forward Garnacho controlled the ball inside West Ham's penalty area before curling a shot past keeper Alphonse Areola.

Brazilian Fred added a third and the 12-times FA Cup winners advanced to a sixth-round home tie against Fulham.

""I had a strong feeling that we still could win the game, you saw the belief, there was composure, there was never a moment of panic,"" Ten Hag said.

Tottenham suffered a 1-0 loss at Championship side Sheffield United after Iliman Ndiaye scored 11 minutes from time to stun the visitors.

""The performance from all the players was first class and the experienced boys at the back were class too,"" Sheffield United manager Paul Heckingbottom told the BBC.

Grimsby Town, 16th in League Two, continued their dream FA Cup run as two penalties by Gavan Holohan knocked out Southampton 2-1 on their own ground and sent the fourth-tier side into the last eight for the first time in 84 years.

Grimsby led 2-0 soon after halftime but Southampton pulled one back through Duje Caleta-Car to ensure a tense finale.

""Just delighted for the players. We kept disciplined. Look at what that means to the support. We turned up, hoping for a miracle and to be in the quarter-final is incredible. It is just a fantastic day,"" Grimsby manager Paul Hurst told ITV.

Grimsby are only the sixth team from the fourth tier or below to reach the last eight of the FA Cup since the introduction of the division in 1958-59.

Both charges are misdemeanors punishable by up to a $1,000 fine and one year in jail.

""It is my understanding that Mr. Carter is making arrangements to turn himself in. At this time, no other charges are pending,"" Lt. Shaun Barnett of the Athens-Clarke County Police Department told Field Level Media on Wednesday.

Carter, 21, was interviewed by police and told authorities he wasn't present at the time of the accident, according to the police report.

But details of the arrest warrant, citing video recorded before the crash, allege Carter was the driver of a 2021 Jeep Trailhawk that pushed LeCroy, who was driving a 2021 Ford Expedition, to speeds exceeding 100 mph.

""The investigation found that (Carter and LeCroy) were operating their vehicles in a manner consistent with racing shortly after leaving the downtown Athens area at about 2:30 AM,"" the warrant from Athens-Clarke County Policy Department said Wednesday. ""The evidence demonstrated that both vehicles switched between lanes, drove in the center turn lane, drove in the opposite lanes of travel, overtook other motorists, and drove at high rates of speed, in an apparent attempt to outdistance each other. Evidence indicate shortly before the crash the Expedition was traveling about 104 miles per hour. The toxicology report indicated that LeCroy's blood alcohol concentration was .197 at the time of the crash. Investigators determined that alcohol impairment, racing, reckless driving and speed were significant contributing factors to the crash.""

The legal blood alcohol concentration limit in Georgia is 0.08 per cent.

Police said the case was given to the Solicitor General's Office on Wednesday.

The report was released just 20 minutes before Carter was scheduled to take the podium in a press conference setting at the 2023 NFL Scouting Combine. Carter is ranked among the top players in the draft and considered a likely top-5 pick in April.

Carter never took the podium because he reportedly left town on Tuesday night.

He was in Indianapolis on Monday and Tuesday and met with teams in formal interviews before the warrant was issued.

Georgia head coach Kirby Smart said his program is still mourning the loss of a player and staff member.

""The charges announced today are deeply concerning, especially as we are still struggling to cope with the devastating loss of two beloved members of our community,"" Smart said in a statement released Wednesday.

""We will continue to cooperate fully with the authorities while supporting these families and assessing what we can learn from this horrible tragedy.""

The warrant was issued just as former Georgia linebacker Nolan Smith was at a podium in Indianapolis in a press conference. He was asked about the crash that killed Willock, who was a good friend.

That's my guy,"" Smith said before emotions began to overtake him, causing his hands and lips to quiver. ""I get sensitive talking about it just because I love him. And he never did anything wrong in his three years. He was supposed to graduate. Most people don't know his brother passed like that. No one should deserve to die like that.""

Smith shook his head as he continued, banging the lectern and removing his steamed glasses from his face covered in tears.

""Three years in a row, that man showed up (and) worked day in and day out. He's a two-time natty champ, man. And it's written in stone. Devin, I love you, baby. Seven-seven (Willock's jersey number), you living forever. 'Do it for Dev,' that's what I tell them boys at Georgia. 'You lost a brother. Do it for Dev.' I'm sorry to get emotional, man.""
