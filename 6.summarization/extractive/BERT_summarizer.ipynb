      Lebron James: Without injured star, can the LA Lakers make the playoffs? Here's how it could happen\n",
       "text            During the Lakers' 27-point comeback victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, TV cameras caught LeBron James saying he heard his foot \"pop\" when landing from a layup. The 38-year-old was seen walking gingerly after the game despite being able to finish the win.\\n\\nJust as the Lakers seem to be building some momentum with a three-game winning streak, with their stars shining and the new additions playing their part, James looks set to be in for a spell on the sidelines.\\n\\nMultiple reports say the 19-time All-Star could miss several weeks, but is awaiting further tests to determine the full extent of the injury.\\n\\nJames posted a photo of his injured foot to his Instagram story on Monday, after it was announced he would miss the match against the Memphis Grizzlies, along with the caption: \"Fkn sucks!!!!\"\\n\\nJust another day in 'Laker Land' -- and it couldn't have come at a worse time.\\n\\nWith 21 games remaining and sitting two spots outside of a spot in the postseason's play-in tournament -- and six spots away from automatic qualification to the playoffs -- the Lakers remain in danger of missing the playoffs for the second successive season. Or will we see those famous yellow and purple uniforms in the NBA's business end of the season?\\n\\nDennis Schröder of the Los Angeles Lakers shoots over Jonas Valančiūnas of the New Orleans Pelicans.\\n\\nSteadily improving\\n\\nFor such a storied franchise and one which was crowned NBA champion just over two years ago, this season has been one full of questions and arguably not one coming up with the right answers.\\n\\nHeading into the season, general manager Rob Pelinka had his work cut out to round out the team's roster, even with superstars like James and Anthony Davis on the books -- all with limited draft capital largely thanks to the widely criticized trade for Russell Westbrook.\\n\\nThe acquisition of Patrick Beverley in August filled a need but many pundits believed that the Lakers had not done enough to put themselves in contention to compete for a title.\\n\\nCriticism from fans and pundits was even louder because of the finite amount of time it appears James has left at the top level as he approaches 40 and Pelinka's inability to build a contender around arguably the NBA's greatest player.\\n\\nSo the season began as many predicted, with the Lakers winning just two of their first 12 games. On November 12, the Lakers were 14th in the Western Conference.\\n\\nTo the credit of first-year head coach Darvin Ham and the team's leading players, the Lakers dug themselves out of a hole, winning eight of their next 10 games.\\n\\nBut down to a combination of injuries, lack of consistency and a lopsided roster, the Lakers struggled to kick on and make a serious surge up the standings or show their championship mettle.\\n\\nMidseason trades seemed to address some of the team's issues of a lack of defense and shooting from the perimeter -- Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt, Mo Bamba and Davon Reed arriving, while Westbrook was finally shipped out.\\n\\nAfter Sunday's win over the Mavericks, Dallas head coach Jason Kidd said Vanderbilt \"kicked our a*s.\"\\n\\nSince the two trades on February 9, the team has gone 4-2 and seemingly turned its season on its head.\\n\\nJames shoots while Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics defends.\\n\\nWhat are chances of the Lakers in the playoffs?\\n\\nIn any NBA season until 2020, the Lakers' chances of competing in the playoffs would be seriously diminished with only eight teams qualifying.\\n\\nBut following the introduction of the play-in tournament during the bubble season in the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, a postseason berth is still within the team's grasp.\\n\\nThe play-in tournament whittles down the teams ranked seventh to 10th in each conference to determine the final two spots in the playoffs. The seventh seeded team hosts the eighth, with the winner earning the No. 7 seed in the playoffs.\\n\\nThe ninth seeded team hosts the 10th ranked side, with the winner facing the loser of the game between the seventh and eighth seeds; the winner of this game will get the eighth and final spot in the playoff bracket.\\n\\nIt means that at the time of writing, the Lakers are currently on a three-game winning streak, have a record of 29-32 and sit 12th in the Western Conference; a game outside the play-in tournament. They are only two-and-a-half games outside of the sixth spot which would qualify them automatically for the playoffs.\\n\\nAccording to the website Tankathon which measures the difficulty of a team's remaining schedule for the rest of the season, the Lakers have the fifth easiest slate of games left.\\n\\nIt has been a far from perfect season for the Lakers so far, but it appears as if they might be coming into some form after the All-Star break.\\n\\nTied in the win column with a similarly imperfect Portland Trail Blazers, we could well be seeing the 17-time NBA champion duking it out in the play-in -- James' injury permitting.\\n\\nWho knows, in a congested Western Conference, the Lakers could even reach the playoffs using the old-fashioned method.\n",

the winner of this game will get the eighth and final spot in the playoff bracket.it means that at the time of writing, the lakers are currently on a three-game winning streak, have a record of 29-32 and sit 12th in the western conference; a game outside the play-in tournament. they are only two-and-a-half games outside of the sixth spot which would qualify them automatically for the playoffs.according to the website tankathon which measures the difficulty of a team's remaining schedule for the rest of the season, the lakers have the fifth easiest slate of games left.it has been a far from perfect season for the lakers so far, but it appears as if they might be coming into some form after the all-star break.tied in the win column with a similarly imperfect portland trail blazers, we could well be seeing the 17-time nba champion duking it out in the play-in -- james' injury permitting.who knows, in a congested western conference, the lakers could even reach the playoffs using the old-fashioned method.\n",

       "      <td>(CNN) Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.\\n\\nWith his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.\\n\\nHe is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.\\n\\n\"I enjoy those moments in the game when I'm just going after people,\" the NBA All-Star said after the game. \"That's all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.\"\\n\\nLillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell's 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.\\n\\nLillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.\\n\\nHe made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting -- even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.\\n\\nHe ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts -- just one off Klay Thompson's record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.\\n\\nLillard's teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell's total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.\\n\\n\"It really, really was a masterful performance,\" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star's game. \"It was a piece of art.

Palestinian sports in general,\" the Palestinian team's goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.\\n\\n\"Whether it's players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.\"\\n\\nOne such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.\\n\\nPalestinian football player Mahmoud Sarsak, who staged a hunger strike of nearly three months while in Israeli jail, is surrounded by relatives and supporters at the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on July 10, 2012 upon his release from prison.\\n\\nPalestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel's \"illegal combatant\" policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.\\n\\nUnder this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.\\n\\nIsrael alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said \"I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.\"\\n\\nBut last year's AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.\\n\\nThey beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.\\n\\nIdentification cards\\n\\nHamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.\\n\\nDespite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.\\n\\n\"The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It's the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,\" the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.\\n\\nPalestinian athletes' movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.\\n\\nPalestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.\\n\\nTo play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.\\n\\nThe president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was \"clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.\"\\n\\nIn a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley &amp; Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.\\n\\nThis can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.\\n\\nIn 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.\\n\\nMakram Daboub (C) became the Palestinian national team's official coach in 2021.\\n\\nThe politics of travel\\n\\nNicknamed the \"Lions of Canaan\" and the \"Fedayeen,\" the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.\\n\\n\"Our training base is in the West Bank, and I'm able to watch the matches here. But I can't watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can't come to the West Bank either,\" said Daboub.\\n\\nThe Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.\\n\\n\"Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,\" Daboub said.\\n\\nIn a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, \"Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.\"\\n\\nDespite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.\\n\\nWith players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.\\n\\nDaboub became the team's official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.\\n\\n\"We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,\" said Daboub.\\n\\nIn 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.\\n\\nWhile FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer's world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won't be changing anytime soon.\\n\\nThis will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.\\n\\nThe team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.\\n\\nBoth tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.\\n\\nMorocco's Ismail El Haddad and Palestinian Yaser Hamed contest the ball in an Arab Cup game in December 2021.\\n\\n\"I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,\" said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.\\n\\n'Love of football'\\n\\nDespite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup -- the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages -- Hamed is positive about 2026.\\n\\nHamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.\\n\\n\"When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him.

\"free palestine,\" while some moroccan players held up the palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against portugal, making the atlas lions the first african and arab team to reach the semifinals.the israeli-palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the middle east since the state of israel's creation in 1948, only made more tense after israel's capture of the west bank, gaza and east jerusalem in 1967.since the state of israel's creation -- in what palestinians call the \"nakba\" and israelis call independence day -- clashes have been frequent.rami hamadeh plays for the palestianian national team against jordan at the mohammed bin zayed stadium in abu dhabi, united arab emirates, afc asian cup.\"nakba\" means catastrophe in arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became israel.\"the israeli occupation doesn't just affect me, but affects ... palestinian sports in general,\" the palestinian team's goalkeeper rami hamadeh told cnn sports.\"whether it's players being arrested or killed. regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 afc asian cup qualification.\"one such player was the 23-year-old ahmed daraghmeh. palestinian officials said daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of tubas near nablus, was fatally shot by the israel defense forces (idf) in 2022, according to reuters. hamas, the militant group that runs gaza, later claimed him as a member.palestinian football player mahmoud sarsak, who staged a hunger strike of nearly three months while in israeli jail, is surrounded by relatives and supporters at the al-shifa hospital in gaza city on july 10, 2012 upon his release from prison.palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. in 2009, israeli authorities detained footballer mahmoud sarsak under israel's \"illegal combatant\" policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.under this policy, israeli authorities can detain palestinians indefinitely. sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.israel alleged he was a member of the islamic jihad group. sarsak rebutted those claims and said \"i deny all the charges i am accused of. i am a sports person, i am a free footballer, i play for peace and the whole world, and i play for lifting the injustice of the palestinian people.\"but last year's afc asian cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.they beat the philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating mongolia and yemen.identification cardshamadeh, like 1.9 million other palestinians living in israel, holds israeli citizenship and currently plays for local east jerusalem team jabal al-mukaber. he previously played for israeli premier league club bnei sakhnin.despite the obstacles palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.\"the ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. i hope that the national team is able to qualify for the world cup. it's the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,\" the 28-year-old hamadeh added.palestinian athletes' movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the israeli military.palestinians in the occupied west bank and the gaza strip hold green ids, while palestinians in jerusalem hold blue ids. palestinians in the west bank cannot travel to gaza or jerusalem unless they have a special israeli-issued travel permit.to play matches in football stadiums palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. in 2019, israel denied travel permits to some players from a gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the west bank.the president of the palestinian football association (pfa) jibril rajoub told ap the denial was \"clear evidence that this israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to fifa.\"in a survey conducted by london-based firm henley &amp; partners, the palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to japan and the united states who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.this can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.in 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against singapore, trailing 4-0, the palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of fifa 2010 qualifiers, making singapore the automatic winners. israel denied the players their travel permits from the gaza strip for travel to singapore.makram daboub (c) became the palestinian national team's official coach in 2021.the politics of travelnicknamed the \"lions of canaan\" and the \"fedayeen,\" the 30-strong palestinian squad is coached by former tunisian football player makram daboub, who told cnn that the politics of travel can be divisive.\"our training base is in the west bank, and i'm able to watch the matches here. but i can't watch or train the players in gaza because of movement restrictions. they can't come to the west bank either,\" said daboub.the gaza strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the israeli and egyptian army since 2007. entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on gazans for travel.\"freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,\" daboub said.in a statement to cnn, a fifa spokesman said, \"visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. in the case of the asian cup, this is the afc and fifa of course for fifa competitions with the host country or countries.\"despite travel restrictions, the palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 afc asian cup which has been postponed to january 2024.with players scattered across various parts of the west bank, jerusalem, gaza, egypt, and portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.daboub became the team's official coach in 2021 and believes the palestinian squad has been steadily improving.\"we have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. qualifying for the 2021 fifa arab cup in qatar and for the asian cup. it is an achievement to qualify for the asian cup, especially for the third time as the national team,\" said daboub.in 2022, the asian football confederation (afc) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the fifa world cup 2026 from 32 to 48. for the first time since 1998, this new format will give asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.while fifa president gianni infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that fifa was reconsidering the 48-team world cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer's world governing body told cnn sports the structure won't be changing anytime soon.this will give the number of asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 fifa world cup, and more possibilities for the palestinian team.the team will first showcase its talent at the west asian football federation (waff) championship before competing in the 2023 afc asian cup.both tournaments will be crucial for asian teams ahead of the next world cup qualifier matches.morocco's ismail el haddad and palestinian yaser hamed contest the ball in an arab cup game in december 2021.\"i believe we can compete in the 2026 fifa world cup. at the 2023 asian cup qualification games in mongolia, we won all three matches. during the 2022 fifa world cup qualifiers, we beat uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against saudi arabia,\" said yaser hamed, who plays center back for the national team.'love of football'despite not progressing to the 2022 world cup -- the palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages -- hamed is positive about 2026.hamed was born in spain to a palestinian father and a spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.\"when my father moved from palestine to spain, he started playing football and he loved it. so maybe the love of football comes from him. maybe it's from the palestinian bloodline,\" hamed added.hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 fifa world

                                                      During the Lakers' 27-point comeback victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, TV cameras caught LeBron James saying he heard his foot \"pop\" when landing from a layup. The 38-year-old was seen walking gingerly after the game despite being able to finish the win.\\n\\nJust as the Lakers seem to be building some momentum with a three-game winning streak, with their stars shining and the new additions playing their part, James looks set to be in for a spell on the sidelines.\\n\\nMultiple reports say the 19-time All-Star could miss several weeks, but is awaiting further tests to determine the full extent of the injury.\\n\\nJames posted a photo of his injured foot to his Instagram story on Monday, after it was announced he would miss the match against the Memphis Grizzlies, along with the caption: \"Fkn sucks!!!!\"\\n\\nJust another day in 'Laker Land' -- and it couldn't have come at a worse time.\\n\\nWith 21 games remaining and sitting two spots outside of a spot in the postseason's play-in tournament -- and six spots away from automatic qualification to the playoffs -- the Lakers remain in danger of missing the playoffs for the second successive season. Or will we see those famous yellow and purple uniforms in the NBA's business end of the season?\\n\\nDennis Schröder of the Los Angeles Lakers shoots over Jonas Valančiūnas of the New Orleans Pelicans.\\n\\nSteadily improving\\n\\nFor such a storied franchise and one which was crowned NBA champion just over two years ago, this season has been one full of questions and arguably not one coming up with the right answers.\\n\\nHeading into the season, general manager Rob Pelinka had his work cut out to round out the team's roster, even with superstars like James and Anthony Davis on the books -- all with limited draft capital largely thanks to the widely criticized trade for Russell Westbrook.\\n\\nThe acquisition of Patrick Beverley in August filled a need but many pundits believed that the Lakers had not done enough to put themselves in contention to compete for a title.\\n\\nCriticism from fans and pundits was even louder because of the finite amount of time it appears James has left at the top level as he approaches 40 and Pelinka's inability to build a contender around arguably the NBA's greatest player.\\n\\nSo the season began as many predicted, with the Lakers winning just two of their first 12 games. On November 12, the Lakers were 14th in the Western Conference.\\n\\nTo the credit of first-year head coach Darvin Ham and the team's leading players, the Lakers dug themselves out of a hole, winning eight of their next 10 games.\\n\\nBut down to a combination of injuries, lack of consistency and a lopsided roster, the Lakers struggled to kick on and make a serious surge up the standings or show their championship mettle.\\n\\nMidseason trades seemed to address some of the team's issues of a lack of defense and shooting from the perimeter -- Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt, Mo Bamba and Davon Reed arriving, while Westbrook was finally shipped out.\\n\\nAfter Sunday's win over the Mavericks, Dallas head coach Jason Kidd said Vanderbilt \"kicked our a*s.\"\\n\\nSince the two trades on February 9, the team has gone 4-2 and seemingly turned its season on its head.\\n\\nJames shoots while Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics defends.\\n\\nWhat are chances of the Lakers in the playoffs?\\n\\nIn any NBA season until 2020, the Lakers' chances of competing in the playoffs would be seriously diminished with only eight teams qualifying.\\n\\nBut following the introduction of the play-in tournament during the bubble season in the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, a postseason berth is still within the team's grasp.\\n\\nThe play-in tournament whittles down the teams ranked seventh to 10th in each conference to determine the final two spots in the playoffs. The seventh seeded team hosts the eighth, with the winner earning the No. 7 seed in the playoffs.\\n\\nThe ninth seeded team hosts the 10th ranked side, with the winner facing the loser of the game between the seventh and eighth seeds; the winner of this game will get the eighth and final spot in the playoff bracket.\\n\\nIt means that at the time of writing, the Lakers are currently on a three-game winning streak, have a record of 29-32 and sit 12th in the Western Conference; a game outside the play-in tournament. They are only two-and-a-half games outside of the sixth spot which would qualify them automatically for the playoffs.\\n\\nAccording to the website Tankathon which measures the difficulty of a team's remaining schedule for the rest of the season, the Lakers have the fifth easiest slate of games left.\\n\\nIt has been a far from perfect season for the Lakers so far, but it appears as if they might be coming into some form after the All-Star break.\\n\\nTied in the win column with a similarly imperfect Portland Trail Blazers, we could well be seeing the 17-time NBA champion duking it out in the play-in -- James' injury permitting.\\n\\nWho knows, in a congested Western Conference, the Lakers could even reach the playoffs using the old-fashioned method.   \n",

                                                                                       (CNN) It's while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.\\n\\nA professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.\\n\\nShe counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.\\n\\nThe film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer -- a young army recruit and the story's protagonist -- notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.\\n\\nUnbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.\\n\\n\"It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film -- that the uniform's more important than the man,\" Paterson tells CNN Sport\\n\\n\"It's just one of those moments where you know it's good and you think: 'Oh my God ... where did this come from?' You feel so lucky that you've thought of it.\"\\n\\nThe scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment\\n\\n\"If we can hold up a mirror to what's going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller -- to effect change,\" says Paterson.\\n\\nFelix Kammerer stars as Paul Bäumer in \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\"\\n\\nFirst portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, \"All Quiet\" focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.\\n\\nPaterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.\\n\\nThe end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world's first mechanized war in chilling detail.\\n\\nIt has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations -- including for best adapted screenplay -- and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations\\n\\nThe BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 -- two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.\\n\\nA five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.\\n\\nThat was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.\\n\\nWith the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.\\n\\n\"I do a lot of one-arm drills,\" says Paterson. \"I was always really good at it and I've got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: 'Well, I can do one arm, let's give this a shot.'\"\\n\\nAfter finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.\\n\\n\"I just kind of kept on going,\" she says. \"And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.\"\\n\\nTriathlete Lesley Paterson competes for Great Britain in Birmingham, Alabama, in 2012.\\n\\nThe experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.\\n\\n\"I don't know if that's the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it's just truly I'm driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,\" she says. \"I'm a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.\"\\n\\nPaterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series -- \"all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,\" she says -- having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.\\n\\nAfter she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in -- and winning -- races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get \"All Quiet\" off the ground.\\n\\n\"Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it's a lot of money,\" says Paterson.\\n\\n\"Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn't necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.\"\\n\\nOver the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she's doing and an obsessive attention to detail.\\n\\n\"I've always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,\" says Paterson.\\n\\n\"People think they are often very separate, but they're actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I'd say that I truly am the athlete I am because I'm an artist and the artist I am because I'm an athlete.\"\\n\\n\"All Quiet on the Western Front\" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed.\\n\\nWhether it's sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of \"looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.\"\\n\\nIt perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 -- the only girl in a team of boys -- and why she chose to tackle \"All Quiet\" at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.\\n\\nThe tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes' \"1917\" four years ago.\\n\\nAnd with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching \"All Quiet\" in German, rather than English.\\n\\n\"There's an authenticity -- it's their story, it's their national novel, it's rightly so that it's in German,\" says Paterson.\\n\\nThe popularity of \"All Quiet\" may take Paterson's life in a different direction, especially now that she's 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.\\n\\nWhatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.\\n\\n\"It's focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes -- that was a huge learning curve for me,\" she says.\\n\\n\"As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you're at ... That's where the beauty comes.\"   \n",

monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.\\n\\nWith his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.\\n\\nHe is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.\\n\\n\"I enjoy those moments in the game when I'm just going after people,\" the NBA All-Star said after the game. \"That's all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.\"\\n\\nLillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell's 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.\\n\\nLillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.\\n\\nHe made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting -- even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.\\n\\nHe ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts -- just one off Klay Thompson's record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.\\n\\nLillard's teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell's total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.\\n\\n\"It really, really was a masterful performance,\" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star's game. \"It was a piece of art. That was incredible.\"\\n\\nAny postgame celebrations for Lillard were cut short after he was picked for a drug test.\\n\\nWith that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain's record of 100 points set in 1962.\\n\\nLillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.\\n\\n\"I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you're hot, you're in attack mode, you're feeling good,\" he said.\\n\\nNot only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.\\n\\nThe Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.\\n\\nThe Trail Blazers stay on the west coast for their next game as they travel to the Bay Area to play the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night.   \n",

European politics since polities started forming -- just ask Julius Caesar, who asked \"Et tu Brute?\" as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.\\n\\nFast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition -- the Champions League -- are akin to a 'House of Cards' plot.\\n\\nDriven by 12 of Europe's biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body's UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams -- the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.\\n\\nIn the Apple TV+ documentary \"Super League: The War for Football,\" the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a \"political thriller ... 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,\" its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.\\n\\nFeaturing almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles -- or its future -- and, most stingingly of all, \"betrayal\" between friends.\\n\\nThe friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.\\n\\nInitially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter's godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was \"sort of the general of the opposing army,\" Zimbalist says.\\n\\n\"The dynamics at play here aren't that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,\" he adds. \"The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.\"\\n\\nAleksander Čeferin was elected UEFA President in 2016.\\n\\nCharacters -- normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews -- are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.\\n\\nČeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother's death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez's about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi's about his tennis playing days.\\n\\n\"This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,\" Zimbalist says. \"These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.\\n\\n\"We were watching what's usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.\"\\n\\n'Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?'\\n\\nBut the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs -- all of whom owned the clubs involved.\\n\\nEven Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to \"drop a legislative bomb\" to prevent the breakaway league forming.\\n\\nPublic opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.\\n\\nAndrea Agnelli was replaced by Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the chairman of the European Club Association.\\n\\nThe documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects' reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.\\n\\n\"That was how we presented it to them,\" Zimbalist says.\\n\\n\"We're going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they're rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.\"\\n\\nBut Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.\\n\\n\"You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,\" he says. \"But then you're leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.\"\\n\\nThe entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport's most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.\\n\\nSo much of football's magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.\\n\\nReal Madrid won the 2022 Champions League.\\n\\nIt epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.\\n\\n\"This identity crisis in the sport -- is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?\" Zimbalist says. \"If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn't fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.\"\\n\\nEuropean governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the \"cynical project,\" as seemingly, did football's world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.\\n\\nThe documentary, however, details FIFA's more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.\\n\\n'The war for football rages on'\\n\\nStill the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with \"60 to 80 teams\" earlier this month.\\n\\nZimbalist's documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by \"old money\" clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by \"new money\" club such as PSG and Manchester City.\\n\\n\"We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,\" he says.\\n\\n\"And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?\"\\n\\nGiorgio Marchetti is the Deputy General Secretary of UEFA.\\n\\nFor Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.\\n\\nJuventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team's representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors -- including Agnelli -- resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor's office in Turin.\\n\\nBarcelona's already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become \"a reality in 2025.\"\\n\\nBut Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN's Richard Quest last month that for them, \"the Super League is in the past.\"\\n\\n\"It was something that we apologized for and ... going forward, it's not something that we're interested in.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile court cases arbitrating the league's fallout rumble on.\\n\\nAn opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.\\n\\nThe ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.\\n\\nThe ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the \"ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,\" Zimbalist says.\\n\\n\"Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.\"   \n",
       "4  (CNN) The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory's presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.\\n\\nFans interrupted press interviews shouting \"free Palestine,\" while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.\\n\\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel's creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel's capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.\\n\\nSince the State of Israel's creation -- in what Palestinians call the \"Nakba\" and Israelis call Independence Day -- clashes have been frequent.\\n\\nRami Hamadeh plays for the Palestianian national team against Jordan at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, AFC Asian Cup.\\n\\n\"Nakba\" means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.\\n\\n\"The Israeli occupation doesn't just affect me, but affects ... Palestinian sports in general,\" the Palestinian team's goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.\\n\\n\"Whether it's players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.\"\\n\\nOne such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.\\n\\nPalestinian football player Mahmoud Sarsak, who staged a hunger strike of nearly three months while in Israeli jail, is surrounded by relatives and supporters at the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on July 10, 2012 upon his release from prison.\\n\\nPalestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel's \"illegal combatant\" policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.\\n\\nUnder this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.\\n\\nIsrael alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said \"I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.\"\\n\\nBut last year's AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.\\n\\nThey beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.\\n\\nIdentification cards\\n\\nHamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.\\n\\nDespite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.\\n\\n\"The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It's the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,\" the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.\\n\\nPalestinian athletes' movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.\\n\\nPalestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.\\n\\nTo play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.\\n\\nThe president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was \"clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.\"\\n\\nIn a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.\\n\\nThis can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.\\n\\nIn 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.\\n\\nMakram Daboub (C) became the Palestinian national team's official coach in 2021.\\n\\nThe politics of travel\\n\\nNicknamed the \"Lions of Canaan\" and the \"Fedayeen,\" the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.\\n\\n\"Our training base is in the West Bank, and I'm able to watch the matches here. But I can't watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can't come to the West Bank either,\" said Daboub.\\n\\nThe Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.\\n\\n\"Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,\" Daboub said.\\n\\nIn a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, \"Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.\"\\n\\nDespite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.\\n\\nWith players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.\\n\\nDaboub became the team's official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.\\n\\n\"We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,\" said Daboub.\\n\\nIn 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.\\n\\nWhile FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer's world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won't be changing anytime soon.\\n\\nThis will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.\\n\\nThe team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.\\n\\nBoth tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.\\n\\nMorocco's Ismail El Haddad and Palestinian Yaser Hamed contest the ball in an Arab Cup game in December 2021.\\n\\n\"I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,\" said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.\\n\\n'Love of football'\\n\\nDespite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup -- the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages -- Hamed is positive about 2026.\\n\\nHamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.\\n\\n\"When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it's from the Palestinian bloodline,\" Hamed added.\\n\\nHamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain's national football team if he's called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.\\n\\n\"I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I'm proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It's like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,\" said Hamed.\\n\\nThe road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.\\n\\nThe president of the Palestinian FA Jibril Rajoub holding a press conference with IOC President Thomas Bach (not seen) after their meeting in Ramallah, West Bank, on September 19, 2022.\\n\\nThe PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad's first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players' health and fitness.\\n\\nDiala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.\\n\\n\"To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,\" said Shaheen.\\n\\n\"The nutritional support that's added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,\" Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been \"shining\" in the Portuguese league.\\n\\nOday Dabbagh, who plays club football in Portugal, is pictured playing for the Palestinian national team against Song Kum Song of North Korea during the 2018 AFC Under-23 Championship in Jiangyin city, east China's Jiangsu province, in January 2018.\\n\\nDabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA -- he plays for Portugal's F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.\\n\\nShaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team's future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.\\n\\nInfrastructure projects\\n\\nThe football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn't always been smooth.\\n\\nOver the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel's control over Palestinian sports.\\n\\nIn 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association's (IFA) membership with FIFA.\\n\\nThey accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.\\n\\nFIFA said Israel didn't violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.\\n\\nDespite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its \"FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.\"\\n\\nAdditionally, FIFA's football infrastructure projects \"include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,\" according to FIFA.\\n\\nInternational Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, back right, and President of the Palestine Olympic Committee Jibril Rajoub, second right, back, meet with young Palestinian athletes at Faisal Al-Husseini stadium in the West Bank city of Al-Ram, north of Jerusalem, in September 2022.\\n\\nGeneral Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces \"won't stop us from our plans.\"\\n\\n\"This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,\" said Hilal.\\n\\n\"There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it's known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,\" Hilal added.\\n\\nOne such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.\\n\\nOn an international level, the football association hasn't hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.\\n\\nMeanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.\\n\\nWhile the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.\\n\\n\"There's a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,\" said General Secretary Abu Hilal.\\n\\n\"For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,\"\\n\\nCoach Daboub goes even further.\\n\\n\"We're going to do what Morocco did in the World Cup,\" he said.   \n",

                                                    during the lakers' 27-point comeback victory over the dallas mavericks on sunday, tv cameras caught lebron james saying he heard his foot \"pop\" when landing from a layup. the 38-year-old was seen walking gingerly after the game despite being able to finish the win.just as the lakers seem to be building some momentum with a three-game winning streak, with their stars shining and the new additions playing their part, james looks set to be in for a spell on the sidelines.multiple reports say the 19-time all-star could miss several weeks, but is awaiting further tests to determine the full extent of the injury.james posted a photo of his injured foot to his instagram story on monday, after it was announced he would miss the match against the memphis grizzlies, along with the caption: \"fkn sucks!!!!\"just another day in 'laker land' -- and it couldn't have come at a worse time.with 21 games remaining and sitting two spots outside of a spot in the postseason's play-in tournament -- and six spots away from automatic qualification to the playoffs -- the lakers remain in danger of missing the playoffs for the second successive season. or will we see those famous yellow and purple uniforms in the nba's business end of the season?dennis schrder of the los angeles lakers shoots over jonas valaninas of the new orleans pelicans.steadily improvingfor such a storied franchise and one which was crowned nba champion just over two years ago, this season has been one full of questions and arguably not one coming up with the right answers.heading into the season, general manager rob pelinka had his work cut out to round out the team's roster, even with superstars like james and anthony davis on the books -- all with limited draft capital largely thanks to the widely criticized trade for russell westbrook.the acquisition of patrick beverley in august filled a need but many pundits believed that the lakers had not done enough to put themselves in contention to compete for a title.criticism from fans and pundits was even louder because of the finite amount of time it appears james has left at the top level as he approaches 40 and pelinka's inability to build a contender around arguably the nba's greatest player.so the season began as many predicted, with the lakers winning just two of their first 12 games. on november 12, the lakers were 14th in the western conference.to the credit of first-year head coach darvin ham and the team's leading players, the lakers dug themselves out of a hole, winning eight of their next 10 games.but down to a combination of injuries, lack of consistency and a lopsided roster, the lakers struggled to kick on and make a serious surge up the standings or show their championship mettle.midseason trades seemed to address some of the team's issues of a lack of defense and shooting from the perimeter -- malik beasley, d'angelo russell, jarred vanderbilt, mo bamba and davon reed arriving, while westbrook was finally shipped out.after sunday's win over the mavericks, dallas head coach jason kidd said vanderbilt \"kicked our a*s.\"since the two trades on february 9, the team has gone 4-2 and seemingly turned its season on its head.james shoots while jayson tatum of the boston celtics defends.what are chances of the lakers in the playoffs?in any nba season until 2020, the lakers' chances of competing in the playoffs would be seriously diminished with only eight teams qualifying.but following the introduction of the play-in tournament during the bubble season in the height of the covid-19 pandemic, a postseason berth is still within the team's grasp.the play-in tournament whittles down the teams ranked seventh to 10th in each conference to determine the final two spots in the playoffs. the seventh seeded team hosts the eighth, with the winner earning the no. 7 seed in the playoffs.the ninth seeded team hosts the 10th ranked side, with the winner facing the loser of the game between the seventh and eighth seeds; the winner of this game will get the eighth and final spot in the playoff bracket.it means that at the time of writing, the lakers are currently on a three-game winning streak, have a record of 29-32 and sit 12th in the western conference; a game outside the play-in tournament. they are only two-and-a-half games outside of the sixth spot which would qualify them automatically for the playoffs.according to the website tankathon which measures the difficulty of a team's remaining schedule for the rest of the season, the lakers have the fifth easiest slate of games left.it has been a far from perfect season for the lakers so far, but it appears as if they might be coming into some form after the all-star break.tied in the win column with a similarly imperfect portland trail blazers, we could well be seeing the 17-time nba champion duking it out in the play-in -- james' injury permitting.who knows, in a congested western conference, the lakers could even reach the playoffs using the old-fashioned method.   \n",

scotland that lesley paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.a professional triathlete and screenwriter, paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. but in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.she counts among those the opening scenes of the oscar-nominated \"all quiet on the western front,\" an adaptation of erich maria remarque's anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.the film begins in the trenches of the first world war, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in germany. there, paul bumer -- a young army recruit and the story's protagonist -- notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.unbeknownst to bumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.\"it really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film -- that the uniform's more important than the man,\" paterson tells cnn sport\"it's just one of those moments where you know it's good and you think: 'oh my god ... where did this come from?' you feel so lucky that you've thought of it.\"the scene, first visualized on a run in the scottish highlands, proved prescient. last year, russian soldiers fighting in ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment\"if we can hold up a mirror to what's going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller -- to effect change,\" says paterson.felix kammerer stars as paul bumer in \"all quiet on the western front.\"first portrayed on screen in a much-loved hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, \"all quiet\" focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.paterson, alongside writing partner ian stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before netflix commissioned it as a german-language film.the end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the armistice talks between german and french officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world's first mechanized war in chilling detail.it has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine oscar nominations -- including for best adapted screenplay -- and a record-equaling 14 bafta nominationsthe bafta awards ceremony will be held on sunday, while the oscars take place on march 13 -- two events that, for paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.a five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.that was in 2016, when paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in costa rica. partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.with the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.\"i do a lot of one-arm drills,\" says paterson. \"i was always really good at it and i've got a very strong leg kick. i practiced in the ocean and i was like: 'well, i can do one arm, let's give this a shot.'\"after finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.\"i just kind of kept on going,\" she says. \"and then i ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. i had to get something done.\"triathlete lesley paterson competes for great britain in birmingham, alabama, in 2012.the experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.\"i don't know if that's the sort of scottish underdog mentality or if it's just truly i'm driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,\" she says. \"i'm a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.\"paterson has mostly competed on the xterra cross-triathlon series -- \"all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,\" she says -- having previously missed out on qualifying for the olympics with great britain at the start of her career.after she moved to california in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in -- and winning -- races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get \"all quiet\" off the ground.\"every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it's a lot of money,\" says paterson.\"me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn't necessarily expected. a big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. it was a massive motivation.\"over the years, paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. she has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she's doing and an obsessive attention to detail.\"i've always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,\" says paterson.\"people think they are often very separate, but they're actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. i'd say that i truly am the athlete i am because i'm an artist and the artist i am because i'm an athlete.\"\"all quiet on the western front\" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed.whether it's sports or scriptwriting, paterson says she has a habit of \"looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.\"it perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 -- the only girl in a team of boys -- and why she chose to tackle \"all quiet\" at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.the tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of sam mendes' \"1917\" four years ago.and with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director edward berger and producer malte grunert suggested pitching \"all quiet\" in german, rather than english.\"there's an authenticity -- it's their story, it's their national novel, it's rightly so that it's in german,\" says paterson.the popularity of \"all quiet\" may take paterson's life in a different direction, especially now that she's 42 and her racing career is almost over. she still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.whatever she does next, paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.\"it's focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes -- that was a huge learning curve for me,\" she says.\"as long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you're at ... that's where the beauty comes.\"   \n",

39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the portland trail blazers beat the houston rockets 121-114.with his effort, lillard became the first player in nba history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.he is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.\"i enjoy those moments in the game when i'm just going after people,\" the nba all-star said after the game. \"that's all it was tonight. i wanted to be in attack mode. i got it going and stayed aggressive.\"lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling donovan mitchell's 71 points against the chicago bulls in january.lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the blazers guard was unplayable.he made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting -- even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.he ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts -- just one off klay thompson's record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.lillard's teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of mitchell's total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.\"it really, really was a masterful performance,\" portland coach chauncey billups said of his star's game. \"it was a piece of art. that was incredible.\"any postgame celebrations for lillard were cut short after he was picked for a drug test.with that performance, lillard entered a pantheon of nba greats. his 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in nba history, though still some way off wilt chamberlain's record of 100 points set in 1962.lillard is behind only chamberlain and kobe bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two nba legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to cbs sports.\"i think any hooper enjoys those moments when you're hot, you're in attack mode, you're feeling good,\" he said.not only was it a brilliant individual showing from lillard, but it was also a much needed one.the blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. portland now sits in 11th place in the western conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the phoenix suns in fourth.the trail blazers stay on the west coast for their next game as they travel to the bay area to play the golden state warriors on tuesday night.   \n",

                                betrayal has formed part of european politics since polities started forming -- just ask julius caesar, who asked \"et tu brute?\" as his friend stabbed him for the good of the roman republic.fast forward to april 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed european super league (esl) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition -- the champions league -- are akin to a 'house of cards' plot.driven by 12 of europe's biggest clubs, the esl intended to break away from european soccer governing body's uefa to create their own competition containing 20 teams -- the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.in the apple tv+ documentary \"super league: the war for football,\" the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a \"political thriller ... 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,\" its emmy-award winning director jeff zimbalist tells cnn sports.featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles -- or its future -- and, most stingingly of all, \"betrayal\" between friends.the friendship between uefa president aleksander eferin and andrea agnelli, then juventus chairman and european club association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.initially so close that agnelli named eferin his daughter's godfather as they worked together on reforming european football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that agnelli had helped formulate the rival esl and was \"sort of the general of the opposing army,\" zimbalist says.\"the dynamics at play here aren't that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,\" he adds. \"the complexity of who to trust. and how deep the wound of betrayal runs.\"aleksander eferin was elected uefa president in 2016.characters -- normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews -- are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.eferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; agnelli about his brother's death; real madrid president florentino prez's about his love of the club; and paris saint-germain president nasser al-khelaifi's about his tennis playing days.\"this is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,\" zimbalist says. \"these are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.\"we were watching what's usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.\"'is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?'but the reverberations of the proposed esl were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled russian oligarchs, american hedge fund billionaires and middle eastern sheikhs -- all of whom owned the clubs involved.even prince william intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then british prime minister boris johnson threatened to \"drop a legislative bomb\" to prevent the breakaway league forming.public opinion became another battleground, with uefa decisively winning the pr war as the esl plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.andrea agnelli was replaced by nasser al-khelaifi as the chairman of the european club association.the documentary is balanced, offering the esl architects' reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.\"that was how we presented it to them,\" zimbalist says.\"we're going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for uefa and the fans and the next 15 minutes they're rooting for the super league because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.\"but zimbalist was wary of casting the esl as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.\"you can very easily just look at uefa vs. the architects of the super league,\" he says. \"but then you're leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.\"the entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport's most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied leicester city winning the premier league in 2016.so much of football's magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the esl would have undermined.real madrid won the 2022 champions league.it epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.\"this identity crisis in the sport -- is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?\" zimbalist says. \"if you look at the super league story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn't fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.\"european governing body uefa too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the \"cynical project,\" as seemingly, did football's world governing body fifa which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.the documentary, however, details fifa's more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with uefa and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.'the war for football rages on'still the conditions that led to the proposed esl continue to plague european football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with \"60 to 80 teams\" earlier this month.zimbalist's documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by \"old money\" clubs such as real madrid and manchester united which are now in turn outspent by \"new money\" club such as psg and manchester city.\"we wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,\" he says.\"and ask big questions about can culture be owned? and how do you govern culture?\"giorgio marchetti is the deputy general secretary of uefa.for barcelona and juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the turin-based team's representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors -- including agnelli -- resigned in november amid an investigation from the public prosecutor's office in turin.barcelona's already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the champions league, and its president said in january that the esl will become \"a reality in 2025.\"but arsenal ceo vinai venkatesham told cnn's richard quest last month that for them, \"the super league is in the past.\"\"it was something that we apologized for and ... going forward, it's not something that we're interested in.\"meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league's fallout rumble on.an opinion issued by the european court of justice (ecj) ruled in december that the measures fifa and uefa took to block the breakaway league were in line with european union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the esl.the ecj will issue its final judgement later this year.the esl in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the \"ideas behind the super league, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,\" zimbalist says.\"maybe the battle of this version of the super league and is perhaps close to over. but the war for football rages on.\"   \n",
       "4  the palestinian team has never taken part in a world cup tournament, but the territory's presence was very much in evidence at qatar 2022.fans interrupted press interviews shouting \"free palestine,\" while some moroccan players held up the palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against portugal, making the atlas lions the first african and arab team to reach the semifinals.the israeli-palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the middle east since the state of israel's creation in 1948, only made more tense after israel's capture of the west bank, gaza and east jerusalem in 1967.since the state of israel's creation -- in what palestinians call the \"nakba\" and israelis call independence day -- clashes have been frequent.rami hamadeh plays for the palestianian national team against jordan at the mohammed bin zayed stadium in abu dhabi, united arab emirates, afc asian cup.\"nakba\" means catastrophe in arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became israel.\"the israeli occupation doesn't just affect me, but affects ... palestinian sports in general,\" the palestinian team's goalkeeper rami hamadeh told cnn sports.\"whether it's players being arrested or killed. regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 afc asian cup qualification.\"one such player was the 23-year-old ahmed daraghmeh. palestinian officials said daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of tubas near nablus, was fatally shot by the israel defense forces (idf) in 2022, according to reuters. hamas, the militant group that runs gaza, later claimed him as a member.palestinian football player mahmoud sarsak, who staged a hunger strike of nearly three months while in israeli jail, is surrounded by relatives and supporters at the al-shifa hospital in gaza city on july 10, 2012 upon his release from prison.palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. in 2009, israeli authorities detained footballer mahmoud sarsak under israel's \"illegal combatant\" policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.under this policy, israeli authorities can detain palestinians indefinitely. sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.israel alleged he was a member of the islamic jihad group. sarsak rebutted those claims and said \"i deny all the charges i am accused of. i am a sports person, i am a free footballer, i play for peace and the whole world, and i play for lifting the injustice of the palestinian people.\"but last year's afc asian cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.they beat the philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating mongolia and yemen.identification cardshamadeh, like 1.9 million other palestinians living in israel, holds israeli citizenship and currently plays for local east jerusalem team jabal al-mukaber. he previously played for israeli premier league club bnei sakhnin.despite the obstacles palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.\"the ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. i hope that the national team is able to qualify for the world cup. it's the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,\" the 28-year-old hamadeh added.palestinian athletes' movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the israeli military.palestinians in the occupied west bank and the gaza strip hold green ids, while palestinians in jerusalem hold blue ids. palestinians in the west bank cannot travel to gaza or jerusalem unless they have a special israeli-issued travel permit.to play matches in football stadiums palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. in 2019, israel denied travel permits to some players from a gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the west bank.the president of the palestinian football association (pfa) jibril rajoub told ap the denial was \"clear evidence that this israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to fifa.\"in a survey conducted by london-based firm henley & partners, the palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to japan and the united states who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.this can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.in 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against singapore, trailing 4-0, the palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of fifa 2010 qualifiers, making singapore the automatic winners. israel denied the players their travel permits from the gaza strip for travel to singapore.makram daboub (c) became the palestinian national team's official coach in 2021.the politics of travelnicknamed the \"lions of canaan\" and the \"fedayeen,\" the 30-strong palestinian squad is coached by former tunisian football player makram daboub, who told cnn that the politics of travel can be divisive.\"our training base is in the west bank, and i'm able to watch the matches here. but i can't watch or train the players in gaza because of movement restrictions. they can't come to the west bank either,\" said daboub.the gaza strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the israeli and egyptian army since 2007. entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on gazans for travel.\"freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,\" daboub said.in a statement to cnn, a fifa spokesman said, \"visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. in the case of the asian cup, this is the afc and fifa of course for fifa competitions with the host country or countries.\"despite travel restrictions, the palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 afc asian cup which has been postponed to january 2024.with players scattered across various parts of the west bank, jerusalem, gaza, egypt, and portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.daboub became the team's official coach in 2021 and believes the palestinian squad has been steadily improving.\"we have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. qualifying for the 2021 fifa arab cup in qatar and for the asian cup. it is an achievement to qualify for the asian cup, especially for the third time as the national team,\" said daboub.in 2022, the asian football confederation (afc) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the fifa world cup 2026 from 32 to 48. for the first time since 1998, this new format will give asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.while fifa president gianni infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that fifa was reconsidering the 48-team world cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer's world governing body told cnn sports the structure won't be changing anytime soon.this will give the number of asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 fifa world cup, and more possibilities for the palestinian team.the team will first showcase its talent at the west asian football federation (waff) championship before competing in the 2023 afc asian cup.both tournaments will be crucial for asian teams ahead of the next world cup qualifier matches.morocco's ismail el haddad and palestinian yaser hamed contest the ball in an arab cup game in december 2021.\"i believe we can compete in the 2026 fifa world cup. at the 2023 asian cup qualification games in mongolia, we won all three matches. during the 2022 fifa world cup qualifiers, we beat uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against saudi arabia,\" said yaser hamed, who plays center back for the national team.'love of football'despite not progressing to the 2022 world cup -- the palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages -- hamed is positive about 2026.hamed was born in spain to a palestinian father and a spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.\"when my father moved from palestine to spain, he started playing football and he loved it. so maybe the love of football comes from him. maybe it's from the palestinian bloodline,\" hamed added.hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 fifa world cup qualification match against singapore, qualifies to play for spain's national football team if he's called, but plays for the palestinian national team instead, despite holding spanish citizenship.\"i thought it was an amazing thing to play for the palestinian national football team because i'm proud to be palestinian. i need to use my voice for the palestinian national team. it's like i can fight for the country. this is very important for me,\" said hamed.the road to fifa 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on november 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.the president of the palestinian fa jibril rajoub holding a press conference with ioc president thomas bach (not seen) after their meeting in ramallah, west bank, on september 19, 2022.the pfa, led by president rajoub and general secretary firas abu hilal, funded the creation of the football squad's first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the asian cup. that medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players' health and fitness.diala shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the palestinian national olympic committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.\"to be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. i can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,\" said shaheen.\"the nutritional support that's added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. i believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,\" shaheen told cnn sports, who adds that oday dabbagh has been \"shining\" in the portuguese league.oday dabbagh, who plays club football in portugal, is pictured playing for the palestinian national team against song kum song of north korea during the 2018 afc under-23 championship in jiangyin city, east china's jiangsu province, in january 2018.dabbagh is the first homegrown palestinian athlete to star in a top european league, according to the pfa -- he plays for portugal's f.c. arouca and will be transferring to belgian league r. charleroi s.c in june of this year.shaheen and the pfa believe this addition will elevate the palestinian team's future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.infrastructure projectsthe football team received fifa membership in 1998 after several attempts. however the relationship between the pfa and fifa hasn't always been smooth.over the years, the pfa has filed numerous complaints to fifa and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with israel's control over palestinian sports.in 2015, the pfa called for the suspension of the israel football association's (ifa) membership with fifa.they accused israel of restricting movements of palestinian players in the west bank and objected to israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the west bank.fifa said israel didn't violate any rules which led the pfa to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by fifa delegates.despite these tensions with the pfa, the world governing body pointed out that through its \"fifa forward programme and in addition to operational funding, fifa has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the palestinians.\"additionally, fifa's football infrastructure projects \"include the installation of a futsal hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at faisal al-husseini stadium,\" according to fifa.international olympic committee president thomas bach, back right, and president of the palestine olympic committee jibril rajoub, second right, back, meet with young palestinian athletes at faisal al-husseini stadium in the west bank city of al-ram, north of jerusalem, in september 2022.general secretary of the pfa hilal told cnn sports that the challenges the organization faces \"won't stop us from our plans.\"\"this is our way as palestinians to get the palestinian message and the name of palestine worldwide through football and through sport,\" said hilal.\"there are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. but it's known that existence is resistance for palestinians, even in the world of sports,\" hilal added.one such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in bethlehem, leaving palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.on an international level, the football association hasn't hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary hilal.meanwhile in 2013, european soccer governing body uefa granted israel hosting rights for the european under 21-championships, which was hosted in tel aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.while the fifa world cup 2026 is still three years away, the palestinian national team is confident the west asian and asian cups may help lead to a fifa 2026 qualification.\"there's a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the asia cup in january 2024 as well as the world cup qualifications,\" said general secretary abu hilal.\"for 2026, we hope as the pfa and with the increase of the members in the world cup, including the quota for asia, that we are able to qualify for the world cup,\"coach daboub goes even further.\"we're going to do what morocco did in the world cup,\" he said.   \n",
