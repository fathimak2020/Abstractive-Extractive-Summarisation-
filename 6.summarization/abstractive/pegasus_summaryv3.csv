https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/28/sport/los-angeles-lakers-players-qualify-nba-spt-intl,"during the lakers' 27-point comeback victory over the dallas mavericks on sunday, tv cameras caught lebron james saying he heard his foot ""pop"" when landing from a layup. the 38-year-old was seen walking gingerly after the game despite being able to finish the win.just as the lakers seem to be building some momentum with a three-game winning streak, with their stars shining and the new additions playing their part, james looks set to be in for a spell on the sidelines.multiple reports say the 19-time all-star could miss several weeks, but is awaiting further tests to determine the full extent of the injury.james posted a photo of his injured foot to his instagram story on monday, after it was announced he would miss the match against the memphis grizzlies, along with the caption: ""fkn sucks!!!!""just another day in 'laker land' -- and it couldn't have come at a worse time.with 21 games remaining and sitting two spots outside of a spot in the postseason's play-in tournament -- and six spots away from automatic qualification to the playoffs -- the lakers remain in danger of missing the playoffs for the second successive season. or will we see those famous yellow and purple uniforms in the nba's business end of the season?dennis schrder of the los angeles lakers shoots over jonas valaninas of the new orleans pelicans.steadily improvingfor such a storied franchise and one which was crowned nba champion just over two years ago, this season has been one full of questions and arguably not one coming up with the right answers.heading into the season, general manager rob pelinka had his work cut out to round out the team's roster, even with superstars like james and anthony davis on the books -- all with limited draft capital largely thanks to the widely criticized trade for russell westbrook.the acquisition of patrick beverley in august filled a need but many pundits believed that the lakers had not done enough to put themselves in contention to compete for a title.criticism from fans and pundits was even louder because of the finite amount of time it appears james has left at the top level as he approaches 40 and pelinka's inability to build a contender around arguably the nba's greatest player.so the season began as many predicted, with the lakers winning just two of their first 12 games. on november 12, the lakers were 14th in the western conference.to the credit of first-year head coach darvin ham and the team's leading players, the lakers dug themselves out of a hole, winning eight of their next 10 games.but down to a combination of injuries, lack of consistency and a lopsided roster, the lakers struggled to kick on and make a serious surge up the standings or show their championship mettle.midseason trades seemed to address some of the team's issues of a lack of defense and shooting from the perimeter -- malik beasley, d'angelo russell, jarred vanderbilt, mo bamba and davon reed arriving, while westbrook was finally shipped out.after sunday's win over the mavericks, dallas head coach jason kidd said vanderbilt ""kicked our a*s.""since the two trades on february 9, the team has gone 4-2 and seemingly turned its season on its head.james shoots while jayson tatum of the boston celtics defends.what are chances of the lakers in the playoffs?in any nba season until 2020, the lakers' chances of competing in the playoffs would be seriously diminished with only eight teams qualifying.but following the introduction of the play-in tournament during the bubble season in the height of the covid-19 pandemic, a postseason berth is still within the team's grasp.the play-in tournament whittles down the teams ranked seventh to 10th in each conference to determine the final two spots in the playoffs. the seventh seeded team hosts the eighth, with the winner earning the no. 7 seed in the playoffs.the ninth seeded team hosts the 10th ranked side, with the winner facing the loser of the game between the seventh and eighth seeds; the winner of this game will get the eighth and final spot in the playoff bracket.it means that at the time of writing, the lakers are currently on a three-game winning streak, have a record of 29-32 and sit 12th in the western conference; a game outside the play-in tournament. they are only two-and-a-half games outside of the sixth spot which would qualify them automatically for the playoffs.according to the website tankathon which measures the difficulty of a team's remaining schedule for the rest of the season, the lakers have the fifth easiest slate of games left.it has been a far from perfect season for the lakers so far, but it appears as if they might be coming into some form after the all-star break.tied in the win column with a similarly imperfect portland trail blazers, we could well be seeing the 17-time nba champion duking it out in the play-in -- james' injury permitting.who knows, in a congested western conference, the lakers could even reach the playoffs using the old-fashioned method.","One of the NBA's all-time greats has been ruled out for the rest of the season after suffering a foot injury in the Los Angeles lakers' win over the Memphis Grizzlies at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, on Sunday."
https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/16/sport/lesley-paterson-all-quiet-on-the-western-front-film-triathlon-spt-intl,"it's while running in the moors and hills of her native scotland that lesley paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.a professional triathlete and screenwriter, paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. but in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.she counts among those the opening scenes of the oscar-nominated ""all quiet on the western front,"" an adaptation of erich maria remarque's anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.the film begins in the trenches of the first world war, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in germany. there, paul bumer -- a young army recruit and the story's protagonist -- notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.unbeknownst to bumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.""it really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film -- that the uniform's more important than the man,"" paterson tells cnn sport""it's just one of those moments where you know it's good and you think: 'oh my god ... where did this come from?' you feel so lucky that you've thought of it.""the scene, first visualized on a run in the scottish highlands, proved prescient. last year, russian soldiers fighting in ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment""if we can hold up a mirror to what's going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller -- to effect change,"" says paterson.felix kammerer stars as paul bumer in ""all quiet on the western front.""first portrayed on screen in a much-loved hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, ""all quiet"" focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.paterson, alongside writing partner ian stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before netflix commissioned it as a german-language film.the end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the armistice talks between german and french officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world's first mechanized war in chilling detail.it has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine oscar nominations -- including for best adapted screenplay -- and a record-equaling 14 bafta nominationsthe bafta awards ceremony will be held on sunday, while the oscars take place on march 13 -- two events that, for paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.a five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.that was in 2016, when paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in costa rica. partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.with the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.""i do a lot of one-arm drills,"" says paterson. ""i was always really good at it and i've got a very strong leg kick. i practiced in the ocean and i was like: 'well, i can do one arm, let's give this a shot.'""after finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.""i just kind of kept on going,"" she says. ""and then i ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. i had to get something done.""triathlete lesley paterson competes for great britain in birmingham, alabama, in 2012.the experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.""i don't know if that's the sort of scottish underdog mentality or if it's just truly i'm driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,"" she says. ""i'm a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.""paterson has mostly competed on the xterra cross-triathlon series -- ""all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,"" she says -- having previously missed out on qualifying for the olympics with great britain at the start of her career.after she moved to california in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in -- and winning -- races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get ""all quiet"" off the ground.""every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it's a lot of money,"" says paterson.""me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn't necessarily expected. a big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. it was a massive motivation.""over the years, paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. she has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she's doing and an obsessive attention to detail.""i've always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,"" says paterson.""people think they are often very separate, but they're actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. i'd say that i truly am the athlete i am because i'm an artist and the artist i am because i'm an athlete.""""all quiet on the western front"" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed.whether it's sports or scriptwriting, paterson says she has a habit of ""looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.""it perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 -- the only girl in a team of boys -- and why she chose to tackle ""all quiet"" at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.the tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of sam mendes' ""1917"" four years ago.and with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director edward berger and producer malte grunert suggested pitching ""all quiet"" in german, rather than english.""there's an authenticity -- it's their story, it's their national novel, it's rightly so that it's in german,"" says paterson.the popularity of ""all quiet"" may take paterson's life in a different direction, especially now that she's 42 and her racing career is almost over. she still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.whatever she does next, paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.""it's focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes -- that was a huge learning curve for me,"" she says.""as long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you're at ... that's where the beauty comes.""","As the world marks the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, the writer and director of one of this year's Palme d'Or contenders talks about the inspiration behind the film's opening scene, which she describes as ""one of those moments where you know it's good and you think: 'oh my god, the uniform's more important than the man.'"""

""that's all it was tonight. i wanted to be in attack mode. i got it going and stayed aggressive.""lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling donovan mitchell's 71 points against the chicago bulls in january.lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the blazers guard was unplayable.he made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting -- even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.he ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts -- just one off klay thompson's record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.lillard's teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of mitchell's total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.""it really, really was a masterful performance,"" portland coach chauncey billups said of his star's game. ""it was a piece of art. that was incredible.""any postgame celebrations for lillard were cut short after he was picked for a drug test.with that performance, lillard entered a pantheon of nba greats. his 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in nba history, though still some way off wilt chamberlain's record of 100 points set in 1962.lillard is behind only chamberlain and kobe bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two nba legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to cbs sports.""i think any hooper enjoys those moments when you're hot, you're in attack mode, you're feeling good,"" he said.not only was it a brilliant individual showing from lillard, but it was also a much needed one.the blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. portland now sits in 11th place in the western conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the phoenix suns in fourth.the trail blazers stay on the west coast for their next game as they travel to the bay area to play the golden state warriors on tuesday night.","It's not every day you see a player score more than 70 points in a game, but that's exactly what happened in the NBA's all-time classic between the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail blazers at the Staples Center."

""the complexity of who to trust. and how deep the wound of betrayal runs.""aleksander eferin was elected uefa president in 2016.characters -- normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews -- are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.eferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; agnelli about his brother's death; real madrid president florentino prez's about his love of the club; and paris saint-germain president nasser al-khelaifi's about his tennis playing days.""this is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,"" zimbalist says. ""these are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.""we were watching what's usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.""'is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?'but the reverberations of the proposed esl were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled russian oligarchs, american hedge fund billionaires and middle eastern sheikhs -- all of whom owned the clubs involved.even prince william intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then british prime minister boris johnson threatened to ""drop a legislative bomb"" to prevent the breakaway league forming.public opinion became another battleground, with uefa decisively winning the pr war as the esl plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.andrea agnelli was replaced by nasser al-khelaifi as the chairman of the european club association.the documentary is balanced, offering the esl architects' reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.""that was how we presented it to them,"" zimbalist says.""we're going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for uefa and the fans and the next 15 minutes they're rooting for the super league because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.""but zimbalist was wary of casting the esl as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.""you can very easily just look at uefa vs. the architects of the super league,"" he says. ""but then you're leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.""the entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport's most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied leicester city winning the premier league in 2016.so much of football's magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the esl would have undermined.real madrid won the 2022 champions league.it epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.""this identity crisis in the sport -- is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?"" zimbalist says. ""if you look at the super league story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn't fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.""european governing body uefa too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the ""cynical project,"" as seemingly, did football's world governing body fifa which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.the documentary, however, details fifa's more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with uefa and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.'the war for football rages on'still the conditions that led to the proposed esl continue to plague european football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with ""60 to 80 teams"" earlier this month.zimbalist's documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by ""old money"" clubs such as real madrid and manchester united which are now in turn outspent by ""new money"" club such as psg and manchester city.""we wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,"" he says.""and ask big questions about can culture be owned? and how do you govern culture?""giorgio marchetti is the deputy general secretary of uefa.for barcelona and juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the turin-based team's representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors -- including agnelli -- resigned in november amid an investigation from the public prosecutor's office in turin.barcelona's already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the champions league, and its president said in january that the esl will become ""a reality in 2025.""but arsenal ceo vinai venkatesham told cnn's richard quest last month that for them, ""the super league is in the past.""""it was something that we apologized for and ... going forward, it's not something that we're interested in.""meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league's fallout rumble on.an opinion issued by the european court of justice (ecj) ruled in december that the measures fifa and uefa took to block the breakaway league were in line with european union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the esl.the ecj will issue its final judgement later this year.the esl in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the ""ideas behind the super league, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,"" zimbalist says.""maybe the battle of this version of the super league and is perhaps close to over. but the war for football rages on.""","The friendship between aleksander eferin and andrea agnelli, then juusvent europe president and club association chairman, was like a ""betrayal"" between friends, according to the director of a new television documentary."

fitness.""to be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. i can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,"" said shaheen.""the nutritional support that's added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. i believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,"" shaheen told cnn sports, who adds that oday dabbagh has been ""shining"" in the portuguese league.oday dabbagh, who plays club football in portugal, is pictured playing for the palestinian national team against song kum song of north korea during the 2018 afc under-23 championship in jiangyin city, east china's jiangsu province, in january 2018.dabbagh is the first homegrown palestinian athlete to star in a top european league, according to the pfa -- he plays for portugal's f.c. arouca and will be transferring to belgian league r. charleroi s.c in june of this year.shaheen and the pfa believe this addition will elevate the palestinian team's future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.infrastructure projectsthe football team received fifa membership in 1998 after several attempts. however the relationship between the pfa and fifa hasn't always been smooth.over the years, the pfa has filed numerous complaints to fifa and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with israel's control over palestinian sports.in 2015, the pfa called for the suspension of the israel football association's (ifa) membership with fifa.they accused israel of restricting movements of palestinian players in the west bank and objected to israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the west bank.fifa said israel didn't violate any rules which led the pfa to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by fifa delegates.despite these tensions with the pfa, the world governing body pointed out that through its ""fifa forward programme and in addition to operational funding, fifa has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the palestinians.""additionally, fifa's football infrastructure projects ""include the installation of a futsal hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at faisal al-husseini stadium,"" according to fifa.international olympic committee president thomas bach, back right, and president of the palestine olympic committee jibril rajoub, second right, back, meet with young palestinian athletes at faisal al-husseini stadium in the west bank city of al-ram, north of jerusalem, in september 2022.general secretary of the pfa hilal told cnn sports that the challenges the organization faces ""won't stop us from our plans.""""this is our way as palestinians to get the palestinian message and the name of palestine worldwide through football and through sport,"" said hilal.""there are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. but it's known that existence is resistance for palestinians, even in the world of sports,"" hilal added.one such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in bethlehem, leaving palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.on an international level, the football association hasn't hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary hilal.meanwhile in 2013, european soccer governing body uefa granted israel hosting rights for the european under 21-championships, which was hosted in tel aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.while the fifa world cup 2026 is still three years away, the palestinian national team is confident the west asian and asian cups may help lead to a fifa 2026 qualification.""there's a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the asia cup in january 2024 as well as the world cup qualifications,"" said general secretary abu hilal.""for 2026, we hope as the pfa and with the increase of the members in the world cup, including the quota for asia, that we are able to qualify for the world cup,""coach daboub goes even further.""we're going to do what morocco did in the world cup,"" he said.","palestinians are celebrating after their team qualified for the semi-finals of the football World Cup for the first time in the territory's history, which is claimed by the state of israel as part of the Middle East peace process."

george foreman, joe frazier, nicola adams, claressa shields and katie taylor become known to global audiences.these days, however, olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.usa boxing accused the russian-led international boxing association (iba) on monday of possible ""sabotage,"" saying the iba had announced a ""false and misleading"" qualification process for the 2024 olympic games.it comes after tension between the iba and the international olympic committee (ioc) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the us, boycotting the forthcoming women's and men's world championships, according to reuters.how did olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with paris 2024 a little over a year away?andy cruz of team cuba dodges a punch from keyshawn davis of team usa during the men's lightweight final at the tokyo 2020 olympics.a long roadtensions started to emerge in 2019.a report, sanctioned by the ioc, into the iba's running of the sport recommended that the iba be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 olympics because of the ""ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.""serbian ioc member nenad lalovic delivered the report to the ioc executive, saying the iba could reach a debt of as much as 29 million swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of june 2021.at the time, iba interim president mohamed moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to ""come together and work together as a unit"" so it can ""continue to fight for our olympic future.""the ioc voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. in a statement, the ioc president thomas bach said there needed to be ""fundamental change"" before the suspension could be lifted and that the olympic governing body's decision was ""taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.""as a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official tokyo games, the iba lost the right to run the qualifications for the tokyo 2020 games. an ioc task force ran the qualification for tokyo 2020 as well as the games themselves.in june 2022, the ioc maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the iba would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the ioc could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.a particular concern for the ioc was the iba's ""financial dependency"" on russian state-owned oil company gazprom, according to the ioc. gazprom has been sanctioned by both the uk and us governments.midway through 2022, the ioc announced the qualification process for the 2024 games in paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the iba due to the ""continuing and very concerning issues"" over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.in a statement the iba said it had been ""dealing with significant governance issues,"" which it said were a ""burden from the past leadership.""""we continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the ioc's upper echelon,"" the statement added.""this culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.""the iba is headed by russian umar kremlev after he was elected in december, 2020.kremlev was re-elected unopposed in may, 2022 after dutch candidate boris van der vorst was declared ineligible. the court of arbitration for sport ruled a month later that van der vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.iba president umar kremlev speaks at a press conference ahead of the 2023 women world boxing championship.iba makes surprise announcementon monday, the iba said its upcoming women's and men's world championships in new delhi in march and tashkent in may will in fact be ""main qualification events"" for paris 2024.the iba's announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the us and the uk, announced they would boycott the events due to the iba allowing russian and belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to reuters.athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation's banners -- or competing in general -- in many sports following russia's invasion of ukraine.belarus helped russia launch its initial invasion of ukraine last february, allowing the kremlin's troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) ukrainian-belarusian border to the north of kyiv.last year, the iba announced it was permitting athletes from both russia and belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against ioc guidelines which recommended that russian and belarusian athletes be banned from competition.in january, 2023, the ioc outlined a multi-step plan for russian and belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 summer games in paris and the 2026 winter games in milan as ""neutral athletes.""about a month later, the us and more than 30 other ""like-minded"" countries released a statement asking the ioc to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of russian and belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.the countries -- including the uk, canada and most of europe -- said in a joint statement that there is ""no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for russian and belarusian athletes.""on wednesday, the ioc reiterated its condemnation of the war in ukraine, saying the ""olympic movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the ukrainian athletes in every way possible.""the iba said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to ""use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.""a series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the olympic games next year after the system was approved by the ioc last september.(left to right) silver medalist pat mccormack, gold medalist cuba's roniel iglesias and bronze medalists russian olympic committee's andrei zamkovoi and ireland's aidan walsh celebrate on the podium after the men's welterweight boxing final at the 2020 olympics.there will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.in a statement sent to cnn, the ioc contradicted the iba's announcement, saying ""the iba will not be involved in paris 2024's boxing qualifications and tournament.""the statement said the iba's suspension was ""still in force"" and that ""the only valid boxing qualification system for paris 2024 is the one approved by the ioc eb in september 2022, published and distributed to nocs and boxing national federations on 6 december 2022.""according to reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 los angeles olympic games, pending reforms demanded by the ioc.usa boxing reactsin a statement on february 20, usa boxing executive director, mike mcatee, called the iba's announcement of qualifying tournaments ""totally unacceptable"" and said it ""clearly intends to cause confusion in the united states and the world boxing community.""""iba is, at best, incompetent. at worst, usa boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the olympic qualification for paris olympic games,"" he said.mcatee added that usa boxing remained ""committed to the olympic movement"" by following the ioc's principles of ""proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from iba leadership and demanding transparent financial management.""on wednesday, ukraine's boxing federation (fbu) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the iba's world championships.fbu vice president oleg ilchenko told public broadcaster suspilne that ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men's and women's championships.""our answer is clear -- our athletes and representatives of the boxing federation of ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely russia and belarus, will compete,"" ilchenko said, per reuters.ilchenko added: ""as long as the war is going on and as russian troops are on the territory of our country

""and then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and i liked guys.""that didn't fit the picture and that wasn't part of my plan. i always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn't address it -- just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.""last month, johnstone became the first all black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.the response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. new zealand rugby stars ruby tui and aaron smith, among others, praised johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister grant robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for ""blazing this trail"" and inspiring ""future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.""""so many people have sent messages of support,"" says johnstone. ""hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.""in that respect, it's been really overwhelming and so positive.""johnstone played for the ospreys in wales, as well as clubs in new zealand and france.on top of his three tests for the all blacks in 2005, johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for canterbury and 38 times for the crusaders. he moved to france in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side biarritz.now, the 43-year-old says he is ""at peace"" in his private life. but he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn't believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the all blacks.""it was kind of like i was stuck between a rock and a hard place,"" says johnstone. ""here was this game and this sport that i loved and enjoyed so much, yet i couldn't be myself. and i felt i was living a double life, basically.""i'd go home and then the anxiety would rise and then i'd go out the door, go to training. but that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. then i'd come home and realize that i'm not actually being truthful to my teammates.""former referee nigel owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former wales international gareth thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.both owens and thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former australia international dan palmer , who came out as gay in 2020, said he ""routinely numbed"" himself with a ""heavy cocktail of opioids"" during his playing career.but johnstone is optimistic about rugby's future.""as long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then i think it'll progress very well,"" he says.""i think rugby is a living culture and it's always progressing and it's progressing in the right directions.""johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days -- largely because he's always been a private person and ""wasn't 100% comfortable"" with his sexuality at the time.he's now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.""i was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so i thought: 'yeah, okay, let's address it and take away that stigma,' because there's always been this stigma around the all blacks and who is the first one and things like that.""if we can open that door and i can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.""after retiring from rugby, johnstone undertook coaching roles in spain, the us and new zealand.he recently visited one of his former clubs, the crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team -- something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.""that, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,"" says johnstone, ""and you'll get better results, i believe.""","For more than a decade, rugby player campbell johnstone kept his sexuality a secret from his team-mates, his coaches and his own family, but he finally decided to come out last month after an ""overwhelming"" response to his announcement."

in over seven years on sunday, that was not the first milestone the american golfer had on his mind.a nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot eric cole at the honda classic in florida sealed the american's fifth pga tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.""i owe everything that i have in my entire life to my sobriety,"" kirk told reporters at pga national resort.""i wouldn't be doing this for a living anymore. i probably wouldn't have the family that i have currently anymore. i came really close to losing everything that i cared about.""for that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that i made, but mostly the grace of god and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.""it's something that's constantly on my mind, so it's pretty easy for me to see that winning the honda classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing i have in my life i owe to that.""kirk during the final round.'i got sober because of you'on the eve of his 34th birthday in may 2019, kirk announced he would be taking an ""indefinite leave"" from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.""i thought i could control it, but after multiple relapses, i have come to realize i can't fix this on my own,"" kirk added in a social media post.by that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth pga tour victory at the colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. he had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 pga tour season.a tied-15th finish at the arnold palmer invitational represented kirk's sole top-40 finish of the campaign.when he returned to the tour at the mayakoba golf classic in november 2019, his rank had fallen even further -- he was world no. 303 -- but kirk was a rejuvenated man.candid interview with the pga tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer's previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.kirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. that switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to ""accelerate"" his alcohol issues.for kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.kirk is congratulated by his caddie after victory.""it's been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, 'i read your story or i heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],"" kirk said.""when i first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. it was more ... for me because i felt i had lived this life for a number of years where i was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.""so the honesty of the process that i went through to get better just felt so good that i had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.""but now on the back end a little bit, it's been amazing. like i said, it's not something that i really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and ... for somebody to say, 'i got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,' you can't really describe how unreal that is with words.""augusta callingon sunday, disaster looked to have struck for kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.the american recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against cole, his 34-year-old compatriot -- ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event -- who was chasing his maiden pga tour title.for both players, it marked their first experience of a pga tour playoff, and for kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.again, kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. however, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.when cole's birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip's hole, kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.as well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, sunday's triumph jumps kirk to the world no. 32 spot and sixth in the fedex cup rankings. just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at the masters in april and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to augusta.""i've been watching that world ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that's going to be something that's incredibly special,"" kirk said.""that par-3 contest can't come soon enough. i'm really looking forward to that. the whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.""on thursday, kirk will tee off in orlando for the arnold palmer invitational. celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for kirk to toast his victory with family.""it'll be a lot of celebrating, and i thank god that alcohol won't be a part of it,"" kirk said.","It had been a long time since the

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/26/us/aaron-rodgers-darkness-retreat-wellness-ctpr,"for four days this week, home for green bay packers quarterback aaron rodgers was a pitch-black room. there were no phones, no television, no lights or distractions. just rodgers, alone with his thoughts, in a cabin built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark.when the four-time nfl mvp announced plans earlier this month to contemplate his nfl future in isolation at a ""darkness retreat,"" many were left scratching their heads.""it's just sitting in isolation, meditation, dealing with your thoughts,"" rodgers said earlier this month . ""we rarely even turn our phone off or put the blinds down to sleep in darkness. i'm really looking forward to it.""rodgers is no stranger to alternative therapies. he credits psychedelics like psilocybin and ayahuasca for helping to alleviate his fear of death and deepening a sense of self-love. the football star said he has done ""many meditation and yoga retreats"" in the past and defended his decision to try darkness therapy as one of several practices ""that have stimulated my mind and helped me get in a better headspace and have a greater peace in my life.""but what exactly happens in a darkness retreat? and is it just another new-age fad or perhaps something that could benefit the rest of us?what happens in the darka darkness retreat is exactly what it sounds like: a prolonged stay in a space completely devoid of light. one of the centers offering the practice is sky cave retreats , nestled in the cascade-siskiyou wilderness, in southern oregon, near klamath falls.the cabins are built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark.""the reasons for doing this range from people wanting to know themselves more, to people who want to rest, reset and relax, to those who want to explore consciousness and deepen their meditation practice,"" said scott berman, who owns sky cave retreats along with his wife jill, adding the darkness helps illuminate what really matters by stripping away the constant bombardment of sensory input and stimulation many people experience in their hectic modern lives.""when someone goes into the darkness, all these things that were important to them like money, fame, power, status, being worthy -- they all become insignificant and meaningless in the dark,"" berman said. ""in the dark, all you have is the present moment which reveals what is truly meaningful -- whether it's love, forgiveness, peace -- and it begins to transform you as you truly authentically touch what is most important to you.""the center currently operates three stand-alone cabins built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark -- earth-sheltered caves, which on the outside are somewhat reminiscent of a hobbit home. each space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation. participants can leave at any time -- the doors are never locked -- and there is a light switch for emergencies which is protected by a childproof guard so it isn't flipped on by accident.the cost includes three meals a day, which berman delivers personally all at once in the evening (through a lightproof double-sided food box) to minimize the disturbance. this is when participants have an opportunity for a conversation, which could be 10 seconds or 30 minutes, according to berman, depending on the person's needs.participants typically spend three to four days in the darkness at a cost of $250 a night and are encouraged to take an extra day before and after to integrate the experience.each space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation.burak dalcik, a 27-year-old salesman from arlington, virginia, said the four days he spent in the dark at sky caves retreats in january gave him clarity about his priorities. he found he no longer labeled experiences as positive or negative, but rather allowed them to come and to go, which led to less stress and anxiety at work and in his personal life. he also said he started calling his mom, who lives back in turkey, more frequently.""it just really trims all the unnecessary fat and allows you to focus on some of the most important things and really allows you to understand who you are,"" said dalcik. ""there's nothing new age about this -- it boils down to can you just sit by yourself with yourself? and if you can't, you should probably get pretty curious about why.""berman cautions the retreat isn't for everyone, nor should it be seen as a quick fix to one's troubles.""it's not like this magical, mind-blowing, amazing experience -- it can be extremely difficult and uncomfortable,"" berman said. ""but in the darkness, discomfort is the door to transformation. there's an acceptance and a profound love that people start to experience when they're no longer resisting that part of themselves.""a therapeutic tool or junk science?for now, there is limited research on how darkness retreats impact the human brain and body. some centers claim the experience can help heal traumas or activate the pineal gland, another claim is darkness therapy increases melatonin production in the brain.""that's totally false,"" said dr. david blask, the head of the laboratory of chrono-neuroendocrine oncology at tulane university school of medicine. ""there may be some psychological benefits that people derive from a darkness retreat that they feel are important for them, but certainly not from a strict endocrine neuroendocrine or biochemical physiological standpoint.""dr. marek mal, a psychologist at the university of ostrava in the czech republic who has been studying darkness therapies since 2010, sees the technique as a promising therapeutic tool.""your thoughts, memories, emotions, inner world and mental processes become much more balanced and integrated,"" mal said.while he and his colleagues are working to secure funding for additional studies, mal said preliminary research showed just four days in a darkness chamber was enough to help increase mindfulness and self-esteem, lower symptoms of depression and anxiety, while improving parasympathetic nervous system functions, which helps with stress management and lowering burnout symptoms. subjects reported feeling the benefits three weeks after the experience.berman said he hopes to see more scientific research into the benefits of darkness retreats, but cautions against anyone seeking to use the retreat for some sort of natural high.""if somebody's coming here because they want to have a so-called dmt experience, you've come into the wrong place,"" he said. ""but there is a lot of benefit in not looking outside of ourselves for confirmation of our worth and using the darkness to illuminate our true nature.""for those who aren't able to commit the time or money for a darkness retreat but want a taste of some of the benefits, berman suggests starting small at home.""it's about becoming accustomed to authentically slowing down, putting the phone away, turning out the lights, closing the blinds and just resting,"" he said. ""not to get somewhere, not to heal but just to be curious about what's actually happening within yourself.""","If you've ever wondered what it's like to spend a week in the dark, here's your answer: it's a new-age therapy designed to help you find peace in the midst of a hectic, stressful life."

(nfs) conducted the first national invitational camp in florida, it has blossomed from hosting 163 players in its inaugural edition to over 300 expected this year -- the nfl said that 319 prospects were invited.representatives from all 32 nfl teams will be in attendance -- from front office staff and coaches to scouts.it is held over four days from thursday, march 2, to sunday, march 5, with each position group getting their own dedicated portion to showcase their skill sets in front of the watching media and nfl teams.defensive linemen and linebackers begin proceedings on thursday before defensive backs try their hand on friday.a statue of former indianapolis colts quarterback peyton manning at lucas oil stadium.the weekend begins with arguably the most important day, with quarterbacks, wide receivers and tight ends displaying their talent saturday before running backs and offensive lineman close out the combine on sunday.not only will teams be able to watch players be put through their paces, but they will also have the opportunity to interview them in an effort to build out a more complete draft profile, including personality and psychological notes, before making a decision on whether they want to draft them.players will also be subjected to medical examinations to allow teams to avoid injury complications down the line.a full testthe tests the prospects will be put through are aimed at challenging their repertoire of physical capabilities to help teams evaluate the whole package.the most notable event is the 40-yard dash which sees prospects sprint the distance to display their top speed.john ross set the record with the fastest 40-yard time in 2017, running 4.22 seconds. last year, it looked like ross' record might have been broken when baylor's tyquan thornton ran an unofficial time of 4.21 seconds -- it was later made official with a time of 4.28 seconds.ross runs the 40-yard dash in a record time of 4.22 seconds in 2017.thornton's baylor teammate, kalon barnes, was just slower with a time of 4.23 seconds. utsa's tariq woolen, who would go on to be voted to the pro bowl after his first season with the seattle seahawks, ran 4.26 seconds.it's unlikely ross' record will be broken, but there are some serious speedsters taking to the running track in indianapolis who could threaten him.other physical drills include a bench press -- where players bench press 225 pounds as many times as possible -- a vertical jump and a broad jump.the final drills -- the three-cone drill, 20-yard shuttle and the 60-yard shuttle -- are all designed to test an athlete's quickness and agility, as they must rush between various points before making short and sharp turns of direction before sprinting in opposite directions.all in all, it is described on the official nfl website as the ""ultimate four-day job interview"" with it holding the possibility of catapulting up the draft list or severely hampering one's stock.the chicago bears

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/06/football/world-cup-final-penalty-shootout-spt-intl,"a soccer match lasts for 90 minutes, another 30 if there really needs to be a winner. but if it's still level after that, then the game will be decided with a penalty shootout , arguably the most nerve-shredding experience in all of sports.for the fans, it's excruciating; at the world cup in qatar , one argentina supporter sobbed uncontrollably as she watched the quarterfinal shootout against the netherlands through her fingers. by the end, she looked distraught. all the emotion had been wrung out of her, and the tears that she cried were of relief, rather than joy.for the players, such emotions are magnified tenfold. ""love hurts,"" goes the anonymous quote, ""but not as much as penalties.""success or failure could be career-defining, one simple kick from 12 yards is weighed down by teammates' hopes and the expectation of potentially millions of fans. as the author karl wiggins put it, ""it's as if, for a few seconds, a player's soul is laid bare for the entire world to see.""very few people would admit to enjoying a shootout, but professor geir jordet is an exception; he can't get enough of them.""a penalty shootout is a very uncomfortable event,"" he told cnn sport from his research facility in oslo. ""it's painful because the pressure is so intense, and of course, the consequences of failing are so dire. penalties, for me, are wonderful!""professor jordet works at the norwegian school of sport sciences, where he specializes in performance under extreme pressure. he's been studying shootouts for almost 20 years and has analyzed more than 200 of them, around 2,000 kicks in total.he's studied the psychology of the event, observed the behavior and dynamics of the participants and crunched the data to conclude that even the most dramatic of shootouts can be swayed by teams who know what they're doing.""the main factor in a penalty shootout is luck,"" the former england goalkeeper peter shilton once declared, but jordet is convinced that it is never ""only a lottery.""aurelien tchouameni misses france's third penalty in the world cup final.penalties are more important than everthe margin between success and failure in title matches seems to be getting slimmer, and so it's in shootouts, where the margins are even tighter, that soccer's biggest prizes are being decided.""if you enter a major tournament today with the ambition to win,"" says jordet, ""you're making a severe mistake if you're not prepared for penalties.""in 2021, both the brazilian men and the canadian women needed penalty wins en route to olympic gold in tokyo; in the same month, argentina survived a shootout to win the copa amrica and italy triumphed in the same way at the european championship at wembley.mohamed salah had to endure laser pointers in the 2021 africa cup of nations final penalty shootout.the following year was a bonanza for penalties.starting in february with senegal's africa cup of nations final win against egypt. liverpool won two english cup finals -- both against chelsea -- on spot-kicks, while real betis and rb leipzig won the spanish and german cup finals respectively from the spot.eintracht frankfurt beat rangers in the europa league final on penalties while the philadelphia union missed all of its kicks to hand lafc the title after an extraordinary mls cup final.the 2022 penalty party concluded in qatar where there was a record five shootouts, including the final.within seconds of the final whistle being blown, jordet can tell if one side has the edge. he's able to glean valuable information simply by observing the interactions on the field.""the coach and the staff of some teams almost panic when the game goes to penalties,"" jordet explained to cnn sport. ""it seems like they don't know what to do. and then with other teams, it's all dealt with before the game and definitely before the penalties.""jurgen klopp won plaudits for the way he managed two penalty shootout victories for liverpool in the league and fa cup finals.last season's fa cup final was a case in point; jordet observed that liverpool's manager jurgen klopp had established a plan and communicated it calmly and warmly to each of his players within 90 seconds of the final whistle.they spent the remaining time casually interacting and even laughing. several more minutes had passed before chelsea's seemingly fraught manager thomas tuchel approached his players, and he was still revising his notes.""he moves to the middle of the circle, before he's done with the plan,"" jordet observed in a tweet thread, ""tuchel then asks his players about the shots, publicly in front of the whole team.""there's plenty of group pressure when done this way, the chance of honest responses from the players drops, and it creates further stress that carries on to the shootout itself.""liverpool's efficient organization meant the players were able to take up a position within the center circle that was closest to their coaching staff, where klopp continued to exude warmth and love.chelsea went on to miss two penalties and liverpool claimed the trophy.world cup final penalty masterclassnobody can influence the proceedings in a shootout more than the goalkeeper, who is involved in every single kick. jordet's research has confirmed that the goalies aren't just there to stop the shots, they can be a positive influence on their teammates and a destructive force for their opponents.in recent seasons, argentina's 30-year-old goalkeeper emiliano martnez has established himself as a gamechanger in shootouts, the ""machiavelli of football.""jordet has noticed that his psychological antics are a nightmare for his opponents. during the semifinal of the copa amrica against colombia in 2021, he intimidated his opponents with trash talk, saving three penalties in a 3-2 win.since the stadiums were empty of fans in that edition, jordet has noted that you could clearly hear what he was saying, ""i can tell you're nervous. i know where you're going to shoot. watch and see how i'm going to eat you up. remember, i'm going to eat you up!""but it was in the world cup final against france that martnez demonstrated the full range of his expertise.jordet says that he set the tone right from the start, arriving first in the penalty area and claiming the territory as his own. ""martnez took a very proactive approach to everything,"" jordet explained.""he created his home in the penalty area. he initiated some handshakes with the first french players to arrive,"" a disarming strategy which makes opponents drop their guard and renders them more vulnerable when he later strikes.argentina fans played their part by pilling pressure on the french penalty takers.for the first two french penalties, martnez discreetly set about disrupting the takers, urging the referee to check the placement of the ball on the spot.this kind of interference would be unsettling for any penalty takers, but he was also feeling out the referee: how much would he be prepared to tolerate?jordet believes that enabled martnez to quickly assume a proactive role within just two kicks and was then able to ""fully get to work.""martnez saved the second penalty that he faced, diving low to his right to deny kingsley coman, and his celebration was exuberant.jordet notes that goalkeepers don't typically celebrate so wildly, but his research has shown that celebrations can influence subsequent events.""we found, to our astonishment, that penalty takers who celebrate intensely have a statistically higher probability of ending up on the winning team.""in fact, the next penalty taker for the opponent misses about 10-15% of the time, and your next [teammate] scores about 7 to 8% more of their penalties. these types of celebratory displays are contagious.""by the time the third french player stepped up, martnez knew that he could get away with almost anything. he snatched up the ball, turned his back on the referee and walked back to his goal line.the approaching aurlien tchouamni should have arrived at the biggest moment of his professional career to find the ball on the spot, instead martnez was holding it, gesturing to the argentine fans to increase the volume.france fans show their support for les bleus during the world cup final.when the referee demanded its return, martnez rolled it away at a 45-degree angle, forcing tchouamni to fetch it himself. jordet has calculated that whenever a player has to wait for a kick, the probability of a goal drops by 20 to 30%.tchouamni aimed low and to the left and missed.by now, martnez knew that his own teammates could face similar tactics from the french goalie hugo lloris, so he grabbed the ball himself and handed it to his incoming teammate leandro paredes, one of four argentine penalty takers, who all scored.martnez was eventually booked for interfering with the fourth french player, randal kolo muani, but by then the damage was done and argentina won the shootout 4-2.""very calculated, creative, well executed,"" jordet concludes, ""but of course also highly, highly cynical.""emiliano martnez of argentina attempted to distract randal kolo muani ahead of his penalty.martnez showed very little remorse for his ""cynical"" actions. after the final he said, """"i have no words for it. i was calm during the penalty shootout and everything went as we wanted.""""all that i have dreamed of has been achieved.""since the conclusion of the world cup, the international football association board (ifab), which determines the laws of football, confirmed to cnn sport that it is looking to clarify what goalkeepers can and cannot do before penalties are taken.this would include delaying the taking of the kick or touching the goalposts, crossbar or goal net.shootouts don't always have to be so negative, though; sometimes, they can be won with love.jordet notes that when lafc's cristian tello missed the first penalty against philadelphia in the mls cup final, some of his teammates met him on his return to the center circle and walked him back in.""you're implicitly saying to the others that even if you miss, you're a part of the group, which is the message that you would like to send to each other in a penalty shootout.""los angeles made every other kick to claim the cup.the power of intangiblessome teams seem to revel in the cauldron of the shootout, while others dread it.england has lost seven of the 10 that it's participated in, while the netherlands have lost seven out of eight. spain's loss to morocco in 2022 means it's now lost a record four shootouts in the fifa world cup alone.jordet has seen enough to believe in ghosts; he says that if your team has lost in a previous shootout, even if you weren't involved in it, you're more likely to miss. conversely, success begets success.having lost to czechoslovakia and the famous antonin panenka penalty i n the european championship final in 1976, germany has won six in a row, croatia has won its last four, and argentina its last three, claiming both the copa amrica and the world cup.more and more teams are coming to accept that understanding the psychology of shootouts is essential in the modern game, and 20 professional teams have already turned to jordet's consultancy business for help.""i totally think there's so much more to be discovered in the softer areas of sports science,"" jordet says, dismissing the cynics who claim that skill development, relationships and psychology are important, but not quantifiable.""i honestly would beg to differ. if you know what to look for, you can measure a lot of these things in games, and this is something i work on every single day. i think we will make some big progress in the years to come.""the moroccan team gathered together for a prayer before going on to beat spain in their penalty shootout.jordet knows so much about penalties because he spent years trawling the archives, watching every single shootout from the world cup, european championship and copa amrica since 1976. he's interviewed 25 players who were there and tested his predictions in practice with 15 elite teams.""i love penalty shootouts,"" he says, ""i think it's the ultimate drama in football.""and yet, much of the nuance he described in the world cup final wouldn't have been obvious to the fans watching the game on tv because broadcasters tend to fill the space between the kicks with replays and closeups of anxious coaches and fans.""the details that really mattered, the subplot of the event, can only be accessed if you're lucky enough to have access to isolated broadcast cameras or by scrolling through fan videos on youtube.""tv producers aren't always my friends,"" jordet concludes, ""because they don't look at what i like to look at.""but now that teams are beginning to realize the value of small details in shootouts, perhaps broadcasters might also consider innovating their approach. the greatest drama in sport is happening right under their noses, and sometimes they're missing the best bits.","penalty shootouts are more important than ever, and so it's in shootouts, where the margins are even tighter, that soccer's biggest drama is played out, writes cnn sport's Tomi Lahren, from Norway."
https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/07/sport/conor-benn-doping-analysis-reaction-spt-intl,"conor benn's scheduled fight with chris eubank jr. last year was meant to be career defining for both men.except the fight never took place and now benn says the fallout of its cancellation has raised serious questions about boxing's drugs testing protocols.the two were scheduled to take to their ring almost exactly 30 years after their fathers had in two fights that gripped a generation of boxing fans. benn and eubank jr. were fighting for more than just glory. this was a fight for family honor.but on the eve of the bout, news of benn failing a drugs test came to light. the bout was called off after benn tested positive for clomiphene, a fertility drug used by women who struggle to ovulate.benn repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and in february 2023, the world boxing council (wbc) issued a statement clearing benn of wrongdoing, stating that while his urine test indicated the presence of prohibited substances, his ""highly-elevated consumption of eggs"" prior to testing offered a ""reasonable explanation"" for his failed test.despite welcoming the news that he could return to the sport, the 26-year-old benn has criticized the investigation and expressed his concerns about the transparency of the process, in particular leveling criticism at the wbc and the british boxing board of control (bbbofc), the governing body for professional boxing in great britain.in a statement posted on his instagram story last week, benn said that ""the manner in which i've been cleared has seemed to create further questions and add further fuel to baseless negative speculation.""cnn has contacted the wbc and bbbofc for comment.cancellationaccording to the u.s. anti-doping agency (usada), clomiphene in men can potentially boost testosterone levels ""by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis."" the drug is also included on the world anti-doping agency's prohibited list under anti-estrogenic substances.benn began his statement on instagram addressing the ruling saying that while he was ""grateful for the ultimate finding"" of being declared ""innocent of being a drugs cheat,"" he couldn't sit by without commenting on the whole investigation.""it was the right decision and it was the only one i was willing to accept. the easy option would have been to accept a six month ban, save myself a huge legal bill and simply move on, by my reputation and my family name is worth more to me than that,"" he wrote.""at no point did i indicate that i failed any vada tests because of contaminated eggs,"" benn wrote, referring to the voluntary anti-doping association (vada), a third-party testing agency used by the fighters to ensure a clean bout and which carried out his test.""as part of its lengthy investigation, the wbc instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet, and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause,"" he wrote, saying he provided a 270-page report to the body.benn added: ""however, i feel like the wbc statement did a disservice to my defence, which was based upon a comprehensive scientific review of the testing procedures which set out a number of reasons why we believed the results were completely unreliable and proved beyond any reasonable doubt that i am innocent.""benn is still under investigation from uk anti-doping (ukad) and the bbcofc at the time of publication.he criticized the bbcofc's handling of his case in his statement.""as for the bbboc, they attacked me publicly and privately during the most difficult time in my life, treating me with utter contempt and without any consideration for the fair process or my mental state.""the bbcofc released their own statement on twitter after the announcement from the wbc in february, saying that it was not ""party to the review"" and had not seen ""any evidence provided on mr. benn's behalf.""it added that while ""it respects the wbc, the wbc is a sanctioning body and not a governing body. the bbcofc was the governing body with whom mr. benn was licensed at the material time, and as such any alleged anti-doping violation shall be dealt with in accordance with its rules and regulations.""it pointed to the uk anti-doping rules, brought in by ukad, which the bbcofc adheres to and that as a result, ""the decision of the wbc does not affect the ongoing implantation of the bbcofc's rules (and those of ukad).""cnn has contacted the bbcofc for comment. ukad declined

that his sample tested negative three times, but ""without explanation"" was tested nine days later which resulted in the positive test.according to benn, he asked for his b sample from the drug test -- which the world anti-doping agency says ""affords the athlete the opportunity to have second analysis performed in the event their a sample returns"" a positive test -- to be tested as soon as possible.benn also said in his statement that he has been advised to take his case to the court of arbitration for sport.benn said that he had never previously tested positive for a banned substance before october's test, adding to his belief that the result was a ""testing error.""while benn now says that he had to concentrate on ""rebuilding"" his career, the process he has gone through has given him ""serious concerns about the whole testing system"" in boxing.""anti-doping protections are obviously extremely important, but so is ensuring people are given due proves and presumed innocent until proven guilty. cheaters should be caught and punished, but people like me who prove their innocent should be vindicated and allowed to continue their career.""benn admitted that he'd had suicidal thoughts as a result of the whole process, saying: ""i didn't think i'd see another day.""""it's hurt me,"" benn said in an interview with piers morgan on talktv. ""i didn't think i was going to make it through this period. i didn't think i was going to make it through.""when asked if he had felt suicidal, benn replied: ""yeah. yeah, i'd say so -- and it upsets me now because i don't know how i got so bad. i got in a really bad way about it.""i was shamed for something i hadn't even done. ... if i had done something wrong, i'm human. i'd raise my hands to it, 'i made a mistake,' whatever it is, i raise my hands. never this.""i felt seven years of hard work and sacrifice, and leaving my family and the image i maintain, was just ruined by somebody else's incompetence. it's been hard for the family.""backgroundat the time of benn's positive test last year, the bout's promoter, matchroom, and that organization's boss, eddie hearn, had been keen for the bout to go ahead despite it being ""prohibited"" by the bbbofc.hearn told the bbc at the time: ""as we stand right now, the bbbofc is not sanctioning the fight. that does not mean the fight is off, but there is a process we have to go through.""conor benn is not suspended, he is free and clear to fight. there's lots going on with the lawyers.""eddie hearn, boxing promoter of matchroom boxing, speaks at the press conference ahead of benn's scheduled fight with eubank jr.amid mounting public pressure and safety concerns, the fight was canceled.the decision to overlook potential safety concerns and stage a bout including a fighter who had tested positive for a banned substance prompted criticism that boxing prioritizes the fight's money-making opportunities rather than the boxers' safety.weeks later, the bbbofc claimed that benn voluntarily relinquished his license with the governing body just before allegations of misconduct against benn were upheld.benn accused the bbbofc of conducting an ""unfair and biased procedure."" he also disputes that he relinquished his license.""(benn) strongly refutes the allegation of misconduct (which for the avoidance of doubt is not in relation to the vada issue) and firmly believes that an independent tribunal will reach a wholly different conclusion,"" a statement said on benn's twitter at the time.and a few months later, the wbc announced after it had conducted an investigation into the matter that benn would be included in its ratings once again after it found that he had not ""engaged in intentional or knowing ingestion of clomiphene.""","The son of two-time world heavyweight champion eubank benn has spoken out for the first time since being declared ""innocent of being a drugs cheat"" by the sport's world governing body and cleared to return to the ring."

it's due to investigations into the team's star player.the grizzlies lost their second straight game tuesday without star guard ja morant , who had been under investigation by police after the 23-year-old posted an instagram live video of himself saturday appearing to hold a gun at a nightclub outside of denver.while police have now decided against charges, the two-time all-star point guard is the subject of an nba investigation, a league spokesperson told cnn.morant has apologized for his actions via his representation on saturday, after memphis announced he would be away from the teammorant said he would take time away ""to get help and work on learning better methods of dealing with stress and my overall well-being.""memphis head coach taylor jenkins said sunday there is no

his fourth nba season.the instagram video, posted early saturday morning and shared widely on social media, shows morant briefly flashing what appears to be a gun while listening to music at a nightclub.the police department in glendale, colorado, a suburb of denver, said wednesday the agency won't recommend charges against morant.""(the department) was not able to determine that probable cause existed for the filing of any charges. in this case, it should be noted that on the night in question (police) did not receive any calls for service at the nightclub regarding a weapon of any

also includes the team plane -- he is subject to nba discipline according to its collective bargaining agreement (cba).the cba states that players are prohibited from carrying firearms while ""physically present at a facility or venue owned, operated, or being used by a team, the nba, or any league-related entity, and whenever a player is traveling on any nba-related business, whether on behalf of the player's team, the nba, or any league-related entity""if a player is in violation of the ruling in the cba, they could face a fine and/or a suspension.""the commissioner shall have the power to suspend for a definite or indefinite period, or to impose a fine not exceeding $50,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon any person who, in his opinion, shall have been guilty of conduct prejudicial or detrimental to the association,"" the cba reads.while it is unclear what punishment morant could face, the most recent example of a gun-related incident came in the 2009/10 season when gilbert arenas, a three-time all-star, was suspended until the end of the season -- 50 games -- for bringing unloaded guns into his team's locker room, and making light of the incident once he was punished.arenas pleaded guilty but avoided jail time and was sentenced to two years of supervised probation, was embroiled in a dispute with teammate javaris crittenton -- who was also suspended the rest of the season for the incident -- over money in a poker game.the us government said at the time that arenas brought at least one firearm into the washington wizards' locker room.arenas would later return to the wizards, while crittenton was released by washington after his suspension, playing two more years of professional basketball before being charged with murder in august 2011. in april 2015, crittenton plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter with a weapon and aggravated assault with a firearm and was sentenced to 23 years in prison.meanwhile, the grizzlies are
