https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/djokovic-pain-free-he-prepares-return-dubai-3308036,"Novak Djokovic said he was now playing without pain after recovering from a hamstring injury as he prepares to return to the ATP Tour in Dubai this week following his record-extending 10th Australian Open title last month.
 
 Djokovic suffered a 3cm hamstring tear en route to winning the Adelaide warm-up event before claiming his 22nd Grand Slam title at Melbourne Park to go level with Rafa Nadal.
 
 The 35-year-old Serb said his Dubai participation was in doubt until a few days ago but he had passed all his fitness tests.
 
 ""Had a couple of weeks of no tennis. The last few days it's really getting as much practice as possible to get myself back in shape to be able to compete at a high level,"" Djokovic said.
 
 ""I haven't felt pain on the court for a week. I'm getting closer to 100 per cent. Still not there in terms of the game and how I feel on court. But the important thing is there's no pain. I don't have a hindrance in the way I move on the court.
 
 ""After every injury it takes time for mechanisms to be balanced, for adjustments to be done on court. It takes time to find that groove of moving effortlessly and not thinking about if something's going to happen. I don't have those thoughts.""
 
 Djokovic begins the Dubai tournament having entered his 378th week as world number one, surpassing Steffi Graf as the player with the most weeks at the top of the sport.
 
 ""It's surreal to be that many weeks number one, to match Graf - one of the all-time greats,"" Djokovic said. ""Just being amongst these legendary names is flattering. I'm proud of it.""

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/future-looking-bright-manchester-united-ten-hag-delivers-silverware-3307216,"LONDON: Manchester United's near six-year trophy drought was almost overlooked in the build-up to the League Cup final as Newcastle United's wait for major silverware spanned nearly seven decades.
 
 A clinical 2-0 victory at Wembley got the Old Trafford trophy cabinet door swinging open again though and, perhaps more importantly, gave a glimpse of greater things to come under astute Dutch manager Erik ten Hag.
 
 The former Ajax Amsterdam boss arrived at Old Trafford with the club in a state of some turmoil on and off the pitch after finishing in sixth place in the Premier League last season.
 
 But while there is little he can do about the future ownership of the 20-time English champions, which the American Glazer family have expressed a wish to sell, on the pitch he is shaping a team that looks capable of reviving the glory days.
 
 A season that began under a Cristiano Ronaldo-shaped cloud has been transformed since the Portuguese talisman was finally shown the door after a toxic fall-out.
 
 Ten Hag has quietly gone about his business, moulding an intelligent team that works tirelessly and is beginning to make winning a habit. A sixth League Cup triumph ended the club's longest wait for a trophy since 1983.
 
 And the season could still get better. They are in the fifth round of the FA Cup, the last 16 of the Europa League after knocking out Barcelona in midweek and in third place in the Premier League and not out of the title race.
 
 Ten Hag experienced some difficult early days. A 4-0 hammering at Brentford in August had some predicting he might be out before the leaves fell off the trees and then there was a humiliating 6-3 defeat at Manchester City.
 
 Since that drubbing at The Etihad in early October, United have lost only twice in all competitions, forward Marcus Rashford has turned into a world-beater and the signing of midfielder Casemiro has looked like a stroke of genius.
 
 A defence built around the terrier-like Lisandro Martinez and the cultured Raphael Varane snuffed out Newcastle on Sunday, winger Antony is becoming a fan favourite and even old-fashioned centre forward Wout Weghorst, a puzzling signing at the time, looks as though he would run through brick walls for Ten Hag.","LONDON: Manchester United's near six-year trophy drought was almost overlooked in the build-up to the League Cup final as Newcastle United's wait for major silverware spanned nearly seven decades.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/clinical-manchester-united-win-league-cup-heartbreak-newcastle-3307061,"LONDON: Manchester United crushed Newcastle United's hopes of a claiming a first domestic trophy for nearly 70 years with a clinical 2-0 victory in the League Cup final at Wembley on Sunday (Feb 26).
 
 A header by Casemiro followed by an own goal by Sven Botman late in the first half silenced the hordes of Newcastle fans who flocked to the capital full of optimism as Manchester United went on to lift the trophy for a sixth time with relative ease.
 
 Much of the build-up was about Newcastle's first appearance in a major final since 1999 and an uptick in their fortunes instigated by Eddie Howe since a 2021 Saudi Arabia-led takeover.
 
 But Erik ten Hag's resurgent United side showed them how far they still need to go as they claimed the club's first trophy since winning the Europa League under Jose Mourinho in 2017 - their longest wait for silverware since 1983.
 
 ""It has been an amazing period, first trophy of the season but we want more it is not enough for this club, we want more and we need more because our standards demand more,"" Bruno Fernandes, who was denied a third goal in stoppage time, said.
 
 ""For me it was about winning trophies and finally we did it. I am satisfied but I want more. I want much more.""
 
 There was little between the sides in a scrappy first half but the English season's first silverware was effectively decided in the space of six minutes towards halftime.
 
 Newcastle were stunned when Brazilian Casemiro met a superb Luke Shaw free kick in the 33rd minute to head past Loris Karius, the goal allowed to stand after a VAR check for offside.
 
 Six minutes later Newcastle were left totally deflated when the in-form Marcus Rashford was played in down the left and his shot deflected over a helpless Karius for what initially appeared to be his 17th goal since the World Cup.
 
 However, it was credited to the unfortunate Botman.
 
 Kicking towards their fans in the second half Newcastle roused themselves into action and pinned a leggy-looking United back at times but they rarely looked like scoring.
 
 Newcastle's fans, who had created a sea of black and white with give-away plastic flags at the stadium's west side during the closing minutes, drifted away before the presentation.
 
 The Tyneside club has now lost each of their last nine matches at Wembley, a run that began in the 1974 FA Cup final.
 
 Instead the stage was left for United whose fans were in full voice as Bruno Fernandes raised the trophy which they hope will be the first of many under Dutchman Ten Hag whose first season goes from strength to strength after some difficult early days.","LONDON: Manchester United crushed Newcastle United's hopes of a claiming a first domestic trophy for nearly 70 years with a clinical 2-0 victory in the League Cup final at Wembley on Sunday (Feb 26).

 Almeria halted Barca's seven game winning streak in the league and delivered another blow to the Catalans who, after going unbeaten in 18 matches in all competitions, have now lost two straight matches after being knocked out of the Europa League on Thursday.
 
 The hosts were the better side in the first half and scored after 24 minutes when Luis Suarez sent a perfect long pass to Toure who was ghosting behind Barca's defence. The Malian striker ran towards the area and hit a thunderous strike in off the crossbar.
 
 It was only the eighth goal Barcelona have conceded in La Liga this season, the least of any team in the top five leagues in Europe.
 
 Almeria should have extended their lead but Leo Baptistao's strike was blocked by goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Rodrigo Ely then missed a sitter from close-range, sending wide a header from a corner when he was all alone in the area.
 
 ""I'm very angry because I think we made the worst game of the season by far, mainly in the first half,"" Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez told Movistar Plus.
 
 ""We were not good and wasted a great opportunity in a match we could not afford to lose after what happened to Real Madrid.
 
 ""It was a golden opportunity today and it ended with a really bad day for us. No excuses, it was the worst showing of our side in the entire season.""
 
 Xavi made five substitutions after the break, but Barca could not beat a disciplined Almeria defence.

 Barca are top of the league standings on 59 points, seven ahead second-placed Real Madrid who were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Atletico Madrid on Saturday. Almeria are 15th on 25 points, two clear of the relegation zone.
 
 Almeria halted Barca's seven game winning streak in the league and delivered another blow to the Catalans who, after going unbeaten in 18 matches in all competitions, have now lost two straight matches after being knocked out of the Europa League on Thursday.
 
 The hosts were the better side in the first half and scored after 24 minutes when Luis Suarez sent a perfect long pass to Toure who was ghosting behind Barca's defence. The Malian striker ran towards the area and hit a thunderous strike in off the crossbar.
 
 It was only the eighth goal Barcelona have conceded in La Liga this season, the least of any team in the top five leagues in Europe.
 
 Almeria should have extended their lead but Leo Baptistao's strike was blocked by goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Rodrigo Ely then missed a sitter from close-range, sending wide a header from a corner when he was all alone in the area.
 
 ""I'm very angry because I think we made the worst game of the season by far, mainly in the first half,"" Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez told Movistar Plus.
 
 ""We were not good and wasted a great opportunity in a match we could not afford to lose after what happened to Real Madrid.
 
 ""It was a golden opportunity today and it ended with a really bad day for us. No excuses, it was the worst showing of our side in the entire season.""

The only goal of the match was scored by El Bilal Toure in the first half, thanks to a perfect long pass from Luis Suarez. Almeria put in a disciplined defensive performance to hold on to their lead and secure three precious points in their battle to avoid relegation. The loss was a second consecutive defeat for Barcelona, who were knocked out of the Europa League on Thursday after going unbeaten in 18 matches in all competitions.

 At the same ground where their title aspirations were dealt a fatal blow last season, Riccardo Orsolini's goal condemned Inter to another loss.
 
 Simone Inzaghi's team are second in the standings on 47 points from 24 matches, 18 behind leaders Napoli who beat Empoli 2-0 on Saturday.
 
 Inter will also be looking over their shoulders with concern at AC Milan and AS Roma, who are level on 44 points and are yet to play in this round of fixtures. Bologna are seventh on 35 points.
 
 Bologna thought they had taken the lead at a rain-sodden Stadio Renato Dall'Ara through Musa Barrow in the 12th minute, only for the effort to be ruled out following a VAR review.
 
 Minutes later, Roberto Soriano rattled the woodwork on the rebound after Andre Onana had parried Andrea Cambiaso's volley into his path.
 
 Inzaghi, missing Federico Dimarco, Milan Skriniar and Joaquin Correa through injury, rested Nicolo Barella among a raft of changes from their midweek Champions League win over Porto, and his much-changed Inter team lacked fluidity.
 
 They had brief spells of possession in the first half, but created few clear-cut chances as Lautaro Martinez headed an Alessandro Bastoni cross just wide of the target and Henrikh Mkhitaryan twice fired over the bar.
 
 Bologna continued to press forward after the break, and Andre Onana kept his side in the game with two crucial saves in quick succession, getting a hand to a Soriano shot before smothering Dominguez's effort from the edge of the area.
 
 Romelu Lukaku and substitute Edin Dzeko each had a shot on target, but it was Bologna who broke the deadlock in the 76th minute when Orsolini raced on to Jerdy Schouten's pass and powered a shot into the net.
 
 ""An incredible match in which many things happened. They cancelled a goal for us, we put Inter down by playing really well and we are satisfied,"" Orsolini told DAZN.
 
 ""Schouten put a ball to me, I took advantage of the bounce to bring the ball forward with my chest and in front of Onana I tried to place it under the crossbar.""

 Can Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton add to his record tally of 103 victories?
 
 There are plenty of storylines to the season that starts in Bahrain on March 5. The following looks at some of them.
 
 TRIPLE MAX
 
 Verstappen will start as favourite for a third title in a row. The Dutch driver won 15 races last year. How many can he bag this time? And can team mate Sergio Perez get closer to him?
 
 NEW BOSSES
 
 Four of the 10 teams have new principals since 2022.
 
 Fred Vasseur has replaced Mattia Binotto at Ferrari, joining from Sauber/Alfa Romeo in January.
 
 McLaren's Andreas Seidl has joined Sauber, appointing Alessandro Alunni Bravo to what is effectively a principal role, with Andrea Stella stepping up at McLaren while James Vowles moved from a strategy role at Mercedes to boss of Williams.
 
 FERRARI
 
 Can Vasseur bring a title to Maranello for the first time since the 2008 constructors' championship?
 
 The Frenchman's arrival has drawn comparisons with compatriot Jean Todt, who led the team through a golden era with Michael Schumacher in the early 2000s.
 
 NEW FACES
 
 There are three rookies on the grid.
 
 Australian Oscar Piastri joined McLaren in controversial circumstances after a contract dispute with Alpine while Nyck de Vries has replaced Pierre Gasly (now with Alpine) at Red Bull-owned AlphaTauri.
 
 Logan Sargeant will meanwhile be making his debut at Williams as the first grand prix racer from the United States since Alexander Rossi in 2015.
 
 OLD FACES
 
 Nico Hulkenberg starts his comeback at Haas, his first full season drive since 2019, with the German still chasing a first podium finish after 179 starts.
 
 Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, now 41, and Hamilton, 38, are the oldest drivers. Can either become the first driver to win a race after reaching the milestone of 300 starts? Alonso has made 355, Hamilton 310.
 
 LAS VEGAS
 
 Las Vegas promises to be the big and brash event of the year with a Saturday night race on the Strip in November as the penultimate round of the season and the hype in over-drive.
 
 Formula One's popularity in America is already surging thanks to Netflix series 'Drive to Survive'.
 
 NEW TEAMS
 
 Andretti Cadillac are seeking to become the 11th team on the grid from 2026. Will the sport let them in?
 
 MERCEDES

 NEW DEAL
 
 Hamilton is out of contract at the end of the year and talks on a new one have started. He will be asked about it regularly.
 
 SPEAKING OUT
 
 The governing FIA has tweaked the rules on drivers making political, personal and religious statements. How will they and the stewards react?

 Is he gone for good from the grid or will he be back in 2024 after signing on as Red Bull reserve? This one could run and run.","Red Bull's Max Verstappen is targeting a third successive Formula One title, rivals Ferrari have a new boss and Las Vegas brings a third U.S. race to the party this season.
 
 Can Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton add to his record tally of 103 victories?
 
 There are plenty of storylines to the season that starts in Bahrain on March 5. The following looks at some of them.
 
 TRIPLE MAX
 
 Verstappen will start as favourite for a third title in a row. The Dutch driver won 15 races last year. How many can he bag this time? And can team mate Sergio Perez get closer to him?
 
 NEW BOSSES
 
 Four of the 10 teams have new principals since 2022.
 
 Fred Vasseur has replaced Mattia Binotto at Ferrari, joining from Sauber/Alfa Romeo in January.
 
 McLaren's Andreas Seidl has joined Sauber, appointing Alessandro Alunni Bravo to what is effectively a principal role, with Andrea Stella stepping up at McLaren while James Vowles moved from a strategy role at Mercedes to boss of Williams.
 
 FERRARI
 
 Can Vasseur bring a title to Maranello for the first time since the 2008 constructors' championship?
 
 The Frenchman's arrival has drawn comparisons with compatriot Jean Todt, who led the team through a golden era with Michael Schumacher in the early 2000s.
 
 NEW FACES
 
 There are three rookies on the grid.
 
 Australian Oscar Piastri joined McLaren in controversial circumstances after a contract dispute with Alpine while Nyck de Vries has replaced Pierre Gasly (now with Alpine) at Red Bull-owned AlphaTauri.
 
 Logan Sargeant will meanwhile be making his debut at Williams as the first grand prix racer from the United States since Alexander Rossi in 2015.
 
 OLD FACES
 
 Nico Hulkenberg starts his comeback at Haas, his first full season drive since 2019, with the German still chasing a first podium finish after 179 starts.
 
 Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, now 41, and Hamilton, 38, are the oldest drivers. Can either become the first driver to win a race after reaching the milestone of 300 starts? Alonso has made 355, Hamilton 310.
 
 LAS VEGAS
 
 Las Vegas promises to be the big and brash event of the year with a Saturday night race on the Strip in November as the penultimate round of the season and the hype in over-drive.
 
 Formula One's popularity in America is already surging thanks to Netflix series 'Drive to Survive'.
 
 NEW TEAMS
 
 Andretti Cadillac are seeking to become the 11th team on the grid from 2026. Will the sport let them in?

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/french-football-bracing-itself-black-tuesday-3309396,"PARIS : French football is bracing itself for a major shakedown as both the president of the federation (FFF) and the women's head coach are expected to resign from their positions on Tuesday.
 
 Noel Le Graet, who has been head of the FFF since 2011, has already taken a step back amid a legal investigation into alleged sexual and moral harassment and a damning audit commissioned by the Sports ministry, will be at the centre of Tuesday's executive committee.
 
 Should he refuse to step down, Le Graet, 81, could be brought before the FFF's disciplinary committee or the executive committee could resign to force new elections.
 
 ""Given the failures in governance, his seriously inappropriate behaviour towards women, I can only agree with the conclusion of the report: he no longer has the legitimacy to administer and represent French soccer,"" Sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera said earlier this month.
 
 Le Graet, who also came under fire when he made dismissive comments about France great Zinedine Zidane after extending men's coach Didier Deschamps's contract until 2026, could be followed into the abyss by the women's coach, Corinne Diacre.
 
 Diacre's position has become untenable since team captain Wendie Renard said last week that she would not play at this year's Women's World Cup to preserve her mental health.
 
 Fellow internationals Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Kadidiatou Diani following suit soon after her announcement, all saying they were taking a step back from the national team.
 
 Renard, who is widely considered one of the best defenders in women's football, played for France in international games against Norway, Denmark and Uruguay earlier this month.
 
 According to a report in French multimedia outlet RMC Sport, Renard will not play for the national team as long as Diacre is in charge.
 
 The 48-year-old Diacre, who in 2014 became the first French woman to coach a men's team when she took charge of then Ligue 2 side Clermont, was appointed France head coach in 2017.
 
 Renard was stripped of the captaincy by Diacre following their quarter-final exit at Euro 2017, before regaining it in 2021.
 
 Diacre had previously attracted criticism from other French players, including Gaetane Thiney and Sarah Bouhaddi.
 
 The coach was also criticised at the European Championship in England last year for leaving out influential senior players Amandine Henry and Eugenie Le Sommer, their all-time leading goalscorer (86 goals), in her squad of 23.
 
 France were eliminated in the semi-finals by Germany.
 
 ""I can no longer support the current system, which is far from the requirements of the highest level,"" said Renard.

 South Africa lost four tests in a row prior to a rain-affected draw in Australia earlier this year, though they were on their way to defeat in that match too.
 
 The batting remains the major concern with the side having not scored more than 255 in any of their last 10 innings, which has led to recalls for Aiden Markram and Ryan Rickelton, and a potential first cap for Tony de Zorzi.
 
 ""It's the start of a new journey and we start with a clean slate. We want to go out there and play the way we want to play. It’s going to be exciting to see how that looks on the field,"" Bavuma told reporters on Monday.
 
 ""The batting unit (struggled) in the last two series in England and Australia, but those are tough tours, generally ones that separate the good guys from the really good guys.
 
 ""The guys who are still here want to man up as the batting unit, we need to score runs to give the bowlers the room to do what they need to do.""
 
 South Africa will likely play an extra batsman at number seven with Heinrich Klaasen to keep wicket, and go in with an all pace attack on the bouncy Highveld wicket in Pretoria.
 
 ""That will still be decided by the coach (Shukri Conrad). We have resources whether we decide to go with a pace (bowling) attack, or with a spin attack. We can back up whatever tactic we go with.""
 
 Bavuma made his test debut against the West Indies in 2014 and admits they are a special opponent for him.
 
 ""West Indies was the team I supported growing up. So there is that sentiment when it comes to them. I made 10 runs on my debut so that was nothing to write home about, hopefully this (first game as captain) goes better.
 
 ""They play old fashioned cricket. Batters grind it out, bowlers are looking to hit their areas outside off stump. They have guys who can stand up to the challenge.

 The left-armer suffered the injury to the middle finger of his bowling hand and was sidelined as Australia lost the opening two tests of the four-match series against India.
 
 With skipper Pat Cummins and batter David Warner ruled out of the contest, the tourists are likely to welcome back Starc and all-rounder Cameron Green.
 
 ""There's going to be a level of discomfort for a while, I don't think it is going to be 100 per cent for a fair while,"" Starc said on Monday. ""But it's certainly good enough. The ball's coming out quite nicely and I feel I'm pretty much at full tilt.
 
 ""It wouldn't be the first test match I've played in some sort of discomfort. If I only played when I was at 100 per cent I would have only played five or 10 tests.
 
 ""I'm happy with where it's at and I've got enough of a pain threshold to deal with that stuff over the last 10 or 12 years.""
 
 Cummins has returned home to be with his ailing mother, leaving Steve Smith, who captained Australia between 2015 and 2018, to lead the side in his absence.
 
 Starc felt the quicks still had a big role to play in the series, which has so far favoured the spinners.
 
 ""It's been a challenge in the last couple of weeks, the first two tests,"" he said.
 
 ""We do see spin playing a huge part in this test series but the quicks have still played a particular role, whether it be with the new ball, if it does reverse-swing, and being able to bowl that skiddy ball and bring the stumps into play.
 
 ""So there's certainly an important role to play for the seam bowlers.""
 
 'NOT UNPLAYABLE'
 
 Indian wicketkeeper Srikar Bharat said the turning wickets that have so far proven to be big challenges for Australia were not totally unplayable.
 
 Bharat scored an unbeaten 23 off 22 deliveries to take India home in the second test in New Delhi and said his mindset was to keep things simple.
 
 ""The wickets aren't unplayable,"" said Bharat. ""If you apply yourself and back your defence, there's scope for a batsman to score runs.
 
 ""At this level everyone intends to score, so shot selection is important on these turners.

 Messi beat his Paris Saint-Germain teammate, and World Cup final rival, Kylian Mbappe to the men's gong with Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema the other contender to claim the prize.
 
 It is the second time that Messi has won the honour inaugurated by FIFA in 2016 after football's world governing body split from Ballon d'Or organisers France Football.
 
 The award, which is voted for by national team coaches and captains, journalists and also fans, recognises a year in which the former Barcelona star crowned his glorious career by leading Argentina to victory at the World Cup.
 
 Messi scored twice in an epic final in Doha as Argentina beat France on penalties despite Mbappe netting a hat-trick for Les Bleus in a remarkable 3-3 draw.
 
 He also claimed the Golden Ball for the best player at the tournament, although Mbappe was the top scorer with eight goals, one more than Messi.
 
 ""This year was just mad for me, to be able to achieve my dream that I had fought so hard for. In the end I got it and it was the most beautiful thing that has happened in my career,"" Messi said of his World Cup win as he collected his award.
 
 ""It is a dream for every footballer but something that very few can make come true,"" added Messi, who was sat in the Paris theatre in between Mbappe and his wife Antonella Roccuzzo.
 
 He took the prize just 24 hours after combining with Mbappe to lead PSG to a 3-0 win against Marseille in Ligue 1.
 
 PUTELLAS PIPS MEAD AND MORGAN
 
 The 35-year-old, a seven-time Ballon d'Or winner, succeeds Robert Lewandowski on the FIFA honours list, while Putellas retained the women's prize despite spending the second half of last year out injured.
 
 The 29-year-old beat England's European Championship-winning striker Beth Mead and United States star Alex Morgan to add the FIFA crown to the Ballon d'Or, which she has also won two years running.
 
 Putellas is currently recovering from a serious knee injury suffered last July which saw her miss the Euro in England with Spain.
 
 Prior to that she had scored 11 goals on Barcelona's run to the Champions League final, which they lost to Lyon.
 
 Putellas has previously said she hopes to return from injury in time to play again this season, but it remains to be seen whether she will feature for Spain at the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in July and August.
 
 Argentina's World Cup win in Qatar was also recognised as Lionel Scaloni claimed the men's coach's honour and Emiliano Martinez was named the best male goalkeeper.

 The France international had an operation on a damaged meniscus in September and also missed the World Cup in Qatar with the national team.
 
 The only time Pogba has been part of the squad this season was as an unused substitute in the 2-0 loss against Monza on Jan. 29.
 
 ""Pogba will be called up for the derby and will play if necessary. He doesn't have much playing time in his legs, but more than enough,"" Allegri told reporters.
 
 ""I have spoken to him as I have done with the other players. He must understand that we're at an important stage of the season. He must have the drive to have given his contribution at the end of the season.""
 
 Allegri added that forward Federico Chiesa, who has been on and off with injuries this season, is also back in regular training after missing recent games.
 
 ""Yesterday, Chiesa trained with the team after six so-so days. Now to say that Pogba can be a starter after 315 days on the sidelines or likewise, Chiesa, who has been out for 10 months, is another thing. A little patience is needed,"" Allegri said.
 
 ""(Leonardo) Bonucci is fine, but due to his long period of inactivity, he'll be sitting close to me at kick-off tomorrow evening. But having him back is already an important plus, he is the club captain after all.""
 
 Allegri's side are eighth in the standings on 32 points, one above city rivals Torino ahead of the home clash, and will aim to expand their winning streak to four league matches.
 
 ""Torino are a team moulded by coach (Ivan) Juric, teams that have a very specific playing system. They attack a lot, they pile on a lot of pressure. These matches are very intense but we've done well at immersing ourselves in these kinds of challenges. If we think we can play on our tiptoes, we're done for,"" Allegri said.
 
 Juve were deducted 15 points for the current season by an Italian soccer court investigating the club's transfer dealings in January. Still, Allegri said that the season's main goal has not changed.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/contes-casts-doubt-spurs-future-champions-league-woes-go-3335751,"LONDON: Antonio Conte's dismal record in the Champions League continued as his Tottenham Hotspur side exited the competition in the last 16 after a dreary 0-0 draw at home to AC Milan on Wednesday (Mar 8).
 
 Tottenham never really threatened to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the first leg and went out with a whimper and boos from the home fans whose patience is running out.
 
 Conte returned to the technical area after missing the last four games following gallbladder surgery but was as subdued as his team on a freezing night in north London.
 
 In six Champions League campaigns with Juventus, Inter Milan, Chelsea and Tottenham, the Italian has only managed to reach the Champions League quarter-finals once.
 
 And with his contract up in June, Wednesday's defeat felt like the beginning of the end of an era even if his side remain in contention to finish in the Premier League top four.
 
 Whether or not Conte remains for the rest of the season is not certain, judging by his comments to Italy's Amazon Prime.
 
 ""I continue to work, I have a contract with Tottenham. I respect the contract. At the end of the season, assessments will be made with the club in the most serene way,"" he said.
 
 ""Let's see how the season ends. Maybe they can send me away even earlier. Perhaps the expectations were higher and may be disappointed. What matters for a coach is trying to work and raise the bar. This year we are struggling to raise the bar.""
 
 Conte tried to talk about Tottenham's last-16 exit as progress, arguing that last season they were in the Europa Conference League, but the fans are unlikely to agree.

 In his news conference later, Conte said he was sorry for the fans but that the club needed to go ""step by step"".
 
 ""I think the situation is very clear. I always say the same things we need time and patience. We don't have solid foundations to fight and win,"" Conte, who dragged Tottenham into fourth place in the Premier League last season, told reporters.

 Messi beat his Paris Saint-Germain teammate, and World Cup final rival, Kylian Mbappe to the men's gong with Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema the other contender to claim the prize.
 
 It is the second time that Messi has won the honour inaugurated by FIFA in 2016 after football's world governing body split from Ballon d'Or organisers France Football.
 
 The award, which is voted for by national team coaches and captains, journalists and also fans, recognises a year in which the former Barcelona star crowned his glorious career by leading Argentina to victory at the World Cup.
 
 Messi scored twice in an epic final in Doha as Argentina beat France on penalties despite Mbappe netting a hat-trick for Les Bleus in a remarkable 3-3 draw.
 
 He also claimed the Golden Ball for the best player at the tournament, although Mbappe was the top scorer with eight goals, one more than Messi.
 
 ""This year was just mad for me, to be able to achieve my dream that I had fought so hard for. In the end I got it and it was the most beautiful thing that has happened in my career,"" Messi said of his World Cup win as he collected his award.
 
 ""It is a dream for every footballer but something that very few can make come true,"" added Messi, who was sat in the Paris theatre in between Mbappe and his wife Antonella Roccuzzo.
 
 He took the prize just 24 hours after combining with Mbappe to lead PSG to a 3-0 win against Marseille in Ligue 1.
 
 PUTELLAS PIPS MEAD AND MORGAN
 
 The 35-year-old, a seven-time Ballon d'Or winner, succeeds Robert Lewandowski on the FIFA honours list, while Putellas retained the women's prize despite spending the second half of last year out injured.
 
 The 29-year-old beat England's European Championship-winning striker Beth Mead and United States star Alex Morgan to add the FIFA crown to the Ballon d'Or, which she has also won two years running.
 
 Putellas is currently recovering from a serious knee injury suffered last July which saw her miss the Euro in England with Spain.
 
 Prior to that she had scored 11 goals on Barcelona's run to the Champions League final, which they lost to Lyon.
 
 Putellas has previously said she hopes to return from injury in time to play again this season, but it remains to be seen whether she will feature for Spain at the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in July and August.
 
 Argentina's World Cup win in Qatar was also recognised as Lionel Scaloni claimed the men's coach's honour and Emiliano Martinez was named the best male goalkeeper.
 
 Meanwhile, England's European Championship victory helped their Dutch manager Sarina Wiegman win the prize for best women's coach, while Mary Earps was named the women's goalkeeper of the year.

 ""Everyone is playing really well and you can't say, 'I'm going to be there forever'.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/novak-djokovic-atp-tennis-world-rankings-number-1-3314351,"Novak Djokovic said his return to the top of the world rankings felt like a big achievement after a year of turmoil where he had to skip several tournaments including two Grand Slams, but the Serbian expects a see-sawing battle for the position in 2023.
 
 Djokovic missed the 2022 Australian Open and was deported from the country due to being unvaccinated against COVID-19 before returning this year to clinch a record-extending 10th title at Melbourne Park and 22nd major to reclaim the number one spot.
 
 He was forced out of big tournaments in the United States last year, including the US Open, as he was unable to enter the country due to his refusal to take his shots.
 
 The 35-year-old also received no points for winning the Wimbledon title due to the grasscourt Grand Slam being penalised for its decision to ban players from Russia and Belarus over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
 
 ""I think this is the least points I've had as number one. It happens,"" Djokovic told reporters following his win over Tomas Machac in Dubai on Tuesday (Feb 28).
 
 ""It's not only due to my circumstances of not playing a couple of Grand Slams and everything that happened last year, but also other players, some players missing some slams for injuries, some not having the biggest consistency.
 
 ""I guess that makes the achievement bigger, at least in my team's and my eyes. I'm overwhelmed with pride. I work as hard as anybody else. I'm really committed to the sport. And I try.""
 
 Djokovic is now into his 378th week as the world number one, surpassing Steffi Graf's record for the most weeks at the top of the sport.
 
 But he said younger players like Carlos Alcaraz and Stefanos Tsitsipas will eventually catch up with him.
 
 ""These guys are playing at a high level constantly. They're playing a lot of tournaments. I'm not playing as much and don't plan to play as many weeks as they do,"" Djokovic said.
