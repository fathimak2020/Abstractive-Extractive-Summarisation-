Here's how it could happen","During the Lakers' 27-point comeback victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, TV cameras caught LeBron James saying he heard his foot ""pop"" when landing from a layup. The 38-year-old was seen walking gingerly after the game despite being able to finish the win.

Just as the Lakers seem to be building some momentum with a three-game winning streak, with their stars shining and the new additions playing their part, James looks set to be in for a spell on the sidelines.

Multiple reports say the 19-time All-Star could miss several weeks, but is awaiting further tests to determine the full extent of the injury.

James posted a photo of his injured foot to his Instagram story on Monday, after it was announced he would miss the match against the Memphis Grizzlies, along with the caption: ""Fkn sucks!!!!""

Just another day in 'Laker Land' -- and it couldn't have come at a worse time.

With 21 games remaining and sitting two spots outside of a spot in the postseason's play-in tournament -- and six spots away from automatic qualification to the playoffs -- the Lakers remain in danger of missing the playoffs for the second successive season. Or will we see those famous yellow and purple uniforms in the NBA's business end of the season?

Steadily improving

For such a storied franchise and one which was crowned NBA champion just over two years ago, this season has been one full of questions and arguably not one coming up with the right answers.

Heading into the season, general manager Rob Pelinka had his work cut out to round out the team's roster, even with superstars like James and Anthony Davis on the books -- all with limited draft capital largely thanks to the widely criticized trade for Russell Westbrook.

The acquisition of Patrick Beverley in August filled a need but many pundits believed that the Lakers had not done enough to put themselves in contention to compete for a title.

Criticism from fans and pundits was even louder because of the finite amount of time it appears James has left at the top level as he approaches 40 and Pelinka's inability to build a contender around arguably the NBA's greatest player.

So the season began as many predicted, with the Lakers winning just two of their first 12 games. On November 12, the Lakers were 14th in the Western Conference.

To the credit of first-year head coach Darvin Ham and the team's leading players, the Lakers dug themselves out of a hole, winning eight of their next 10 games.

But down to a combination of injuries, lack of consistency and a lopsided roster, the Lakers struggled to kick on and make a serious surge up the standings or show their championship mettle.

Midseason trades seemed to address some of the team's issues of a lack of defense and shooting from the perimeter -- Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt, Mo Bamba and Davon Reed arriving, while Westbrook was finally shipped out.

After Sunday's win over the Mavericks, Dallas head coach Jason Kidd said Vanderbilt ""kicked our a*s.""

Since the two trades on February 9, the team has gone 4-2 and seemingly turned its season on its head.

What are chances of the Lakers in the playoffs?

In any NBA season until 2020, the Lakers' chances of competing in the playoffs would be seriously diminished with only eight teams qualifying.

But following the introduction of the play-in tournament during the bubble season in the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, a postseason berth is still within the team's grasp.

The play-in tournament whittles down the teams ranked seventh to 10th in each conference to determine the final two spots in the playoffs. The seventh seeded team hosts the eighth, with the winner earning the No. 7 seed in the playoffs.

The ninth seeded team hosts the 10th ranked side, with the winner facing the loser of the game between the seventh and eighth seeds; the winner of this game will get the eighth and final spot in the playoff bracket.

It means that at the time of writing, the Lakers are currently on a three-game winning streak, have a record of 29-32 and sit 12th in the Western Conference; a game outside the play-in tournament. They are only two-and-a-half games outside of the sixth spot which would qualify them automatically for the playoffs.

According to the website Tankathon which measures the difficulty of a team's remaining schedule for the rest of the season, the Lakers have the fifth easiest slate of games left.

It has been a far from perfect season for the Lakers so far, but it appears as if they might be coming into some form after the All-Star break.

Tied in the win column with a similarly imperfect Portland Trail Blazers, we could well be seeing the 17-time NBA champion duking it out in the play-in -- James' injury permitting.

A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.

She counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.

The film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer -- a young army recruit and the story's protagonist -- notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.

Unbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.

""It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film -- that the uniform's more important than the man,"" Paterson tells CNN Sport

""It's just one of those moments where you know it's good and you think: 'Oh my God ... where did this come from?' You feel so lucky that you've thought of it.""

The scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment

""If we can hold up a mirror to what's going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller -- to effect change,"" says Paterson.

Felix Kammerer stars as Paul Bäumer in ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""

First portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, ""All Quiet"" focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.

Paterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.

The end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world's first mechanized war in chilling detail.

It has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations -- including for best adapted screenplay -- and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations

The BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 -- two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.

A five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.

That was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.

With the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.

""I do a lot of one-arm drills,"" says Paterson. ""I was always really good at it and I've got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: 'Well, I can do one arm, let's give this a shot.'""

After finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.

""I just kind of kept on going,"" she says. ""And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.""

Triathlete Lesley Paterson competes for Great Britain in Birmingham, Alabama, in 2012.

The experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.

""I don't know if that's the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it's just truly I'm driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,"" she says. ""I'm a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.""

Paterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series -- ""all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,"" she says -- having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.

After she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in -- and winning -- races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get ""All Quiet"" off the ground.

""Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it's a lot of money,"" says Paterson.

""Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn't necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.""

Over the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she's doing and an obsessive attention to detail.

""I've always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,"" says Paterson.

""People think they are often very separate, but they're actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I'd say that I truly am the athlete I am because I'm an artist and the artist I am because I'm an athlete.""

""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed.

Whether it's sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of ""looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.""

It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 -- the only girl in a team of boys -- and why she chose to tackle ""All Quiet"" at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.

The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes' ""1917"" four years ago.

And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching ""All Quiet"" in German, rather than English.

""There's an authenticity -- it's their story, it's their national novel, it's rightly so that it's in German,"" says Paterson.

The popularity of ""All Quiet"" may take Paterson's life in a different direction, especially now that she's 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.

Whatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.

""It's focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes -- that was a huge learning curve for me,"" she says.

""As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you're at ... That's where the beauty comes.""",['George Ramsay'],2023-02-16
2,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/sport/damian-lillard-71-points-record-nba-spt-intl,Damian Lillard becomes first player in NBA history to score over 70 points in under 40 minutes,"(CNN) Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

""I enjoy those moments in the game when I'm just going after people,"" the NBA All-Star said after the game. ""That's all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.""

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell's 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting -- even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts -- just one off Klay Thompson's record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard's teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell's total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

""It really, really was a masterful performance,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star's game. ""It was a piece of art. That was incredible.""

Any postgame celebrations for Lillard were cut short after he was picked for a drug test.

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain's record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

""I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you're hot, you're in attack mode, you're feeling good,"" he said.

Not only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.

The Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.

3,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/football/super-league-documentary-football-jeff-zimbalist-spt-intl,A 'political thriller' filled with personal betrayals. The inside story of the Super League and the war for soccer's soul,"(CNN) Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming -- just ask Julius Caesar, who asked ""Et tu Brute?"" as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition -- the Champions League -- are akin to a 'House of Cards' plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe's biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body's UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams -- the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary ""Super League: The War for Football,"" the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a ""political thriller ... 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,"" its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles -- or its future -- and, most stingingly of all, ""betrayal"" between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter's godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was ""sort of the general of the opposing army,"" Zimbalist says.

""The dynamics at play here aren't that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,"" he adds. ""The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.""

Aleksander Čeferin was elected UEFA President in 2016.

Characters -- normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews -- are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother's death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez's about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi's about his tennis playing days.

""This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,"" Zimbalist says. ""These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

""We were watching what's usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.""

'Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?'

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs -- all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to ""drop a legislative bomb"" to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

Andrea Agnelli was replaced by Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the chairman of the European Club Association.

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects' reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

""That was how we presented it to them,"" Zimbalist says.

""We're going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they're rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.""

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

""You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,"" he says. ""But then you're leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.""

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport's most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football's magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

Real Madrid won the 2022 Champions League.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

""This identity crisis in the sport -- is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?"" Zimbalist says. ""If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn't fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.""

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the ""cynical project,"" as seemingly, did football's world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA's more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

'The war for football rages on'

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with ""60 to 80 teams"" earlier this month.

Zimbalist's documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by ""old money"" clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by ""new money"" club such as PSG and Manchester City.

""We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,"" he says.

""And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?""

Giorgio Marchetti is the Deputy General Secretary of UEFA.

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team's representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors -- including Agnelli -- resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor's office in Turin.

Barcelona's already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become ""a reality in 2025.""

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN's Richard Quest last month that for them, ""the Super League is in the past.""

""It was something that we apologized for and ... going forward, it's not something that we're interested in.""

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league's fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the ""ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,"" Zimbalist says.

""Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.""",['Issy Ronald'],2023-02-27

Now, Palestinian national team wants a slice of the action at 2026 tournament","(CNN) The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory's presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting ""free Palestine,"" while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel's creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel's capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel's creation -- in what Palestinians call the ""Nakba"" and Israelis call Independence Day -- clashes have been frequent.

Rami Hamadeh plays for the Palestianian national team against Jordan at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, AFC Asian Cup.

""Nakba"" means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

""The Israeli occupation doesn't just affect me, but affects ... Palestinian sports in general,"" the Palestinian team's goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

""Whether it's players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.""

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian football player Mahmoud Sarsak, who staged a hunger strike of nearly three months while in Israeli jail, is surrounded by relatives and supporters at the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on July 10, 2012 upon his release from prison.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel's ""illegal combatant"" policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said ""I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.""

But last year's AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

""The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It's the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,"" the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes' movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was ""clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.""

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

Makram Daboub (C) became the Palestinian national team's official coach in 2021.

The politics of travel

Nicknamed the ""Lions of Canaan"" and the ""Fedayeen,"" the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

""Our training base is in the West Bank, and I'm able to watch the matches here. But I can't watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can't come to the West Bank either,"" said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

""Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,"" Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, ""Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.""

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team's official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

""We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,"" said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer's world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won't be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

Morocco's Ismail El Haddad and Palestinian Yaser Hamed contest the ball in an Arab Cup game in December 2021.

""I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,"" said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

'Love of football'

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup -- the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages -- Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

""When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it's from the Palestinian bloodline,"" Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain's national football team if he's called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

""I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I'm proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It's like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,"" said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players' health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

""To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,"" said Shaheen.

""The nutritional support that's added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,"" Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been ""shining"" in the Portuguese league.

Oday Dabbagh, who plays club football in Portugal, is pictured playing for the Palestinian national team against Song Kum Song of North Korea during the 2018 AFC Under-23 Championship in Jiangyin city, east China's Jiangsu province, in January 2018.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA -- he plays for Portugal's F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team's future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn't always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel's control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association's (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn't violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its ""FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.""

Additionally, FIFA's football infrastructure projects ""include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,"" according to FIFA.

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, back right, and President of the Palestine Olympic Committee Jibril Rajoub, second right, back, meet with young Palestinian athletes at Faisal Al-Husseini stadium in the West Bank city of Al-Ram, north of Jerusalem, in September 2022.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces ""won't stop us from our plans.""

""This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,"" said Hilal.

""There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it's known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,"" Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn't hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.

While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.

""There's a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,"" said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

""For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,""

Coach Daboub goes even further.

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible ""sabotage,"" saying the IBA had announced a ""false and misleading"" qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women's and men's world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

Andy Cruz of Team Cuba dodges a punch from Keyshawn Davis of Team USA during the men's lightweight final at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA's running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the ""ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.""

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to ""come together and work together as a unit"" so it can ""continue to fight for our Olympic future.""

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be ""fundamental change"" before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body's decision was ""taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.""

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA's ""financial dependency"" on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the ""continuing and very concerning issues"" over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been ""dealing with significant governance issues,"" which it said were a ""burden from the past leadership.""

""We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC's upper echelon,"" the statement added.

""This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.""

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women's and men's world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be ""main qualification events"" for Paris 2024.

The IBA's announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation's banners -- or competing in general -- in many sports following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin's troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as ""neutral athletes.""

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other ""like-minded"" countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries -- including the UK, Canada and most of Europe -- said in a joint statement that there is ""no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.""

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the ""Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.""

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to ""use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.""

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

(Left to right) Silver medalist Pat McCormack, gold medalist Cuba's Roniel Iglesias and bronze medalists Russian Olympic Committee's Andrei Zamkovoi and Ireland's Aidan Walsh celebrate on the podium after the men's welterweight boxing final at the 2020 Olympics.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA's announcement, saying ""the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024's boxing qualifications and tournament.""

The statement said the IBA's suspension was ""still in force"" and that ""the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.""

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA's announcement of qualifying tournaments ""totally unacceptable"" and said it ""clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.""

""IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,"" he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained ""committed to the Olympic movement"" by following the IOC's principles of ""proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.""

On Wednesday, Ukraine's boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA's world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men's and women's championships.

""Our answer is clear -- our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,"" Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

Ilchenko added: ""As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country ... they will not participate.""",['Ben Morse'],2023-02-24

Now, he wants to open the door for more people to come out","(CNN) During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with ""the best right shoulder in the game,"" according to one of his former coaches.

He played three times for the All Blacks -- a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand -- and represented club teams at home and overseas.

But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.

""I loved playing rugby,"" he tells CNN Sport . ""And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.

""That didn't fit the picture and that wasn't part of my plan. I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn't address it -- just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.""

Last month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.

The response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for ""blazing this trail"" and inspiring ""future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.""

""So many people have sent messages of support,"" says Johnstone. ""Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.

""In that respect, it's been really overwhelming and so positive.""

Johnstone played for the Ospreys in Wales, as well as clubs in New Zealand and France.

On top of his three Tests for the All Blacks in 2005, Johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for Canterbury and 38 times for the Crusaders. He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.

Now, the 43-year-old says he is ""at peace"" in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn't believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.

""It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,"" says Johnstone. ""Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn't be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.

""I'd go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I'd go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I'd come home and realize that I'm not actually being truthful to my teammates.""

Former referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.

Both Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer , who came out as gay in 2020, said he ""routinely numbed"" himself with a ""heavy cocktail of opioids"" during his playing career.

But Johnstone is optimistic about rugby's future.

""As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it'll progress very well,"" he says.

""I think rugby is a living culture and it's always progressing and it's progressing in the right directions.""

Johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days -- largely because he's always been a private person and ""wasn't 100% comfortable"" with his sexuality at the time.

He's now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.

""I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: 'Yeah, okay, let's address it and take away that stigma,' because there's always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.

""If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.""

After retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.

He recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team -- something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.

""That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,"" says Johnstone, ""and you'll get better results, I believe.""",['George Ramsay'],2023-02-23

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and the Serbian, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

""Look, last year I did miss both Indian Wells, Miami and all the US Open swing,"" 22-time grand slam winner Djokovic told reporters in Belgrade on Wednesday.

""So it wouldn't be the first time if it does happen. I mean, I hope it doesn't, but that's all I can do. All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There's not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,"" he said.

The Serbian tennis star told reporters in Belgrade that he would ""love to be there"" at this year's US Open.

Casting an eye to the US Open grand slam at the end of August, the 35-year-old said: ""Well, (the) US Open is still far away, you know, it's six months away. So I, I hope that I will be able to be there. I can't give you any additional answers really to that. You know, US Open is one of the four biggest events in the history of our sport.

Not so for soccer star Alyssa Thompson , who had to think about the more pressing matter of her classes the next morning.

The 18-year-old Thompson made headlines when she was selected as the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NWSL draft by Angel City FC in January, becoming the first high schooler in history to be drafted in the history of the league.

""I was very nervous,"" she tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies.

""And just like all the emotions were coming to me at that moment. I just was really shocked and couldn't believe this is really happening right now.""

Not to be overwhelmed by her status as a new NWSL star, the senior at Harvard-Westlake is adamant that she is still focused on school, even if she has to juggle her studies with a professional soccer career.

""Once I'm done with practice, I don't have another thing to do. So I think I'll do my schoolwork,"" she says. ""As long as it gets me to graduate, I'll do it.""

Thompson is no stranger to balancing school and soccer -- whether its weekend trips to tournaments or training camps -- and in October she went one better, making her debut for the US Women's National Team in a friendly against European Champion England in London.

In front of a packed-out Wembley Stadium, Thompson was subbed on for USWNT superstar Megan Rapinoe, a moment that will stay with her for life.

Alyssa Thompson made her debut for the national team as a substitute for Megan Rapinoe.

""That was so crazy! I don't know how to describe it. I was just really nervous, and I was going in for Megan Rapinoe!"" she recalls. ""I don't think I was even processing it in the moment.""

Thompson will have to get used to lining up with the biggest stars in the sport. Angel City boasts a line-up of celebrity owners, including Serena Williams, Natalie Portman, Becky G, Eva Longoria and Mia Hamm.

And the stars are not limited to the sidelines. When the NWSL season kicks off next month, Thompson will be a part of an all-star team featuring two-time world champion Christen Press and Thompson's personal hero Sydney Leroux.

Inspiring on and off the field

Thompson is not only breaking records as the first high school No. 1 draft pick. She also became the first player of Peruvian and Filipino heritage to be picked at No. 1, something that is not lost on her.

Despite her youth, Thompson doesn't simply want to play soccer, but she also wants to be the inspiration for the next generation of girls playing the game.

""I think that being able to be a woman of color just as a role model for little girls is such an amazing thing,"" she tells CNN Sport. ""Being able to look up to someone that looks like them is such a cool thing to have.""

Thompson is used to being a role model having served as one for her younger sisters, Gisele and Zoe, her whole life. Both want to emulate Thompson's success.

Gisele is already on that path after becoming the first high school player, along with Alyssa, to sign a name, image and likeness deal with Nike. She also has emulated her older sister by playing for the USWNT youth teams, featuring at the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup.

Alyssa Thompson will hope make her debut for Angel City next month when the NWSL season kicks off.

The pair have been inseparable, playing together from when they could walk all the way to the present, where they have featured together for the Total Futbol Academy of MLS Next, a boys' team in Southern California.

Despite Thompson's youth, she already sees herself as far more than just an athlete -- someone who has the power to inspire a new generation of soccer players in the US.

""For my youngest sister, Zoe, being able to just be an inspiration for her and a role model for her to look up to, I think has really helped me put things into perspective for what I really want to do and how I want to be a role model for little kids,"" she says.

While making her NSWL debut in Los Angeles is first on Thompson's to-do list, the far bigger prize is in Australia and New Zealand in the shape of the Women's World Cup, which kicks off in July.

Having tasted international senior soccer in October and now training regularly with USWNT players at club level, Thompson is hungry to be a part of the biggest showpiece in women's soccer.

It's a tall order for the young striker. The US boasts the deepest pool of players to choose from of any team and is coming into the tournament as the reigning champion, albeit on a low ebb.

Both of Thompson's appearances for the team came in losses to England and Spain before the US lost to Germany, marking the first time the team has lost three games in a row since 1993.

Head coach Vlatko Andonovski has very little margin for error as he looks to lead the US to a third consecutive title and Thompson will have to seriously impress if she wants to make it onto the plane heading across the Pacific.

""I'm going to do everything that I can to be able to make the roster and I'm just going to work hard towards that goal,"" Thompson says.

""If I continue to grow as a player and continue to thrive in the NWSL environment, then I feel like I have a chance.""

A slim chance, maybe, but Thompson is no stranger to making the seemingly impossible look routine.","['Amanda Davies', 'Alasdair Howorth']",2023-02-25

Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday, that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind.

A nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American's fifth PGA Tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.

""I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety,"" Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort.

""I wouldn't be doing this for a living anymore. I probably wouldn't have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.

""For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.

""It's something that's constantly on my mind, so it's pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.""

Kirk during the final round.

'I got sober because of you'

On the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019, Kirk announced he would be taking an ""indefinite leave"" from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.

""I thought I could control it, but after multiple relapses, I have come to realize I can't fix this on my own,"" Kirk added in a social media post.

By that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.

A tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk's sole top-40 finish of the campaign.

When he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further -- he was world No. 303 -- but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.

candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer's previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.

Kirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to ""accelerate"" his alcohol issues.

For Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.

Kirk is congratulated by his caddie after victory.

""It's been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, 'I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],"" Kirk said.

""When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more ... for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.

""So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.

""But now on the back end a little bit, it's been amazing. Like I said, it's not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and ... for somebody to say, 'I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,' you can't really describe how unreal that is with words.""

Augusta calling

On Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.

The American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot -- ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event -- who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.

For both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.

Again, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.

When Cole's birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip's hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.

As well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday's triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.

""I've been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that's going to be something that's incredibly special,"" Kirk said.

""That par-3 contest can't come soon enough. I'm really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.""

On Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.

""It'll be a lot of celebrating, and I thank God that alcohol won't be a part of it,"" Kirk said.",['Jack Bantock'],2023-02-27

""Sportswashing"" refers to governments using high-profile sporting events to project a favorable image of their country around the world, often to draw attention away from alleged wrongdoing.

""Despite horrific human rights records, both states enjoy generous F1 contracts and exploit the F1 platform to sanitize their image on the world stage, while thousands of political prisoners languish behind bars,"" Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, BIRD's Advocacy Director, said in a statement commenting on the letter on Monday.

Two judges both scored the fight 76-73 for Fury, with the third judge ruling 75-74 in favor of Paul at the end of their eight-round cruiserweight bout at the Diriyah Arena near the capital Riyadh

""In my first main event, 23 years old, I had the world on my shoulders, and I came through,"" Fury said after the fight. ""This, to me, is a world title fight. I trained so hard for this. This was my destiny.""

British reality TV star Tommy Fury (C) celebrates after his split decision win against US YouTuber Jake Paul.

Paul, a 26-year-old American with more than 20 million YouTube subscribers, is now 6-1 while Fury, the British younger half-brother of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury , remains undefeated with nine wins after taking time out of his boxing career in 2019 to star in reality show ""Love Island.""

Millions of fans were expected to tune into the fight, the latest pay-per-view bout involving a YouTuber to generate a social media buzz as promoters played up the bad blood between the two fighters. And just like a genuine world title fight, there were plenty of stars ringside, including former champ Mike Tyson, soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and comedian Kevin Hart.

Fury asserted his jab early to keep Paul at a distance but the YouTuber gained momentum in the fifth round, appearing to stun Fury.

Both had points deducted -- Paul in the fifth for pushing his opponent's head down while clinching and Fury in the sixth for too much clinching, a defensive tactic that's often only allowed for short periods of time.

Mike Tyson is seen before the fight in Riyadh's Diriyah Arena, Saudi Arabia.

Fury was knocked down in the eighth round on a short-left hand by Paul but it was too late as the judges ruled in Fury's favor.

Paul said he intended to use a rematch clause for Sunday's fight that could be exercised if Fury won.

""All respect to Tommy, he won, don't judge me by my wins, judge me by my losses. I'll come back, I thought I deserve that rematch, it was a great fight, a close fight,"" Paul said after the fight.

Paul only began boxing in 2018, but had since gone on to record six wins prior to Sunday -- including four knockouts. Fury, however, was the first professional boxer Paul faced.","['Homero De La Fuente', 'Tara Subramaniam']",2023-02-27

Because not just once, but twice during his third round, American golfer Akshay Bhatia was forced into an impromptu wardrobe change at the PGA National Resort in Palm Beach, Florida.

The first came at the sixth hole, when the 21-year-old's tee drive settled in the muddy banks on the left of the fairway. A shirtless shot followed as Bhatia successfully scooped his ball back onto the fairway, the splashes of mud across his chest suggesting that the shirt removal was a smart decision.

A superb approach and putt saw the world No. 357 save par superbly, yet despite the best efforts of his caddie and a towel, the hole had left its mark on Bhatia. Fortunately, his girlfriend was on hand with a change of clothes, and the golfer pushed on with his round.

Bhatia tracks his shot from the sixth hole.

Bhatia had been riding the wave of an excellent second round, but effectively saw any chance of a first PGA Tour victory collapse across four holes. A run of bogey, par, double bogey and bogey saw Bhatia arrive at the par-three 15th hole needing a big response, only for his tee shot to sail over the flag and into the swampy area behind the green.

The Atlanta Braves hitter looked as confused as everyone else on Saturday when the new pitch clock regulation sparked confusion during a spring training game between the Braves and the Boston Red Sox.

With the game tied at 6-6, Conley was sitting on a full count against Robert Kwiatkowski.

However, as the pitch clock hit eight seconds, umpire John Libka jumped in to award strike three with Conley not yet squared up to receive the delivery.

Confused by what had just happened, Conley appeared to jog towards first base thinking that it was Kwiatkowski who had received a time violation for taking too long to pitch his delivery.

Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday, that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind.

A nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American's fifth PGA Tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.

""I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety,"" Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort.

""I wouldn't be doing this for a living anymore. I probably wouldn't have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.

""For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.

""It's something that's constantly on my mind, so it's pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.""

Kirk during the final round.

'I got sober because of you'

On the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019, Kirk announced he would be taking an ""indefinite leave"" from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.

""I thought I could control it, but after multiple relapses, I have come to realize I can't fix this on my own,"" Kirk added in a social media post.

By that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.

A tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk's sole top-40 finish of the campaign.

When he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further -- he was world No. 303 -- but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.

candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer's previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.

Kirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to ""accelerate"" his alcohol issues.

For Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.

Kirk is congratulated by his caddie after victory.

""It's been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, 'I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],"" Kirk said.

""When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more ... for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.

""So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.

""But now on the back end a little bit, it's been amazing. Like I said, it's not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and ... for somebody to say, 'I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,' you can't really describe how unreal that is with words.""

Augusta calling

On Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.

The American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot -- ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event -- who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.

For both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.

Again, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.

When Cole's birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip's hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.

As well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday's triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.

""I've been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that's going to be something that's incredibly special,"" Kirk said.

""That par-3 contest can't come soon enough. I'm really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.""

On Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.

""It'll be a lot of celebrating, and I thank God that alcohol won't be a part of it,"" Kirk said.",['Jack Bantock'],2023-02-27

Not so for soccer star Alyssa Thompson , who had to think about the more pressing matter of her classes the next morning.

The 18-year-old Thompson made headlines when she was selected as the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NWSL draft by Angel City FC in January, becoming the first high schooler in history to be drafted in the history of the league.

""I was very nervous,"" she tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies.

""And just like all the emotions were coming to me at that moment. I just was really shocked and couldn't believe this is really happening right now.""

Not to be overwhelmed by her status as a new NWSL star, the senior at Harvard-Westlake is adamant that she is still focused on school, even if she has to juggle her studies with a professional soccer career.

""Once I'm done with practice, I don't have another thing to do. So I think I'll do my schoolwork,"" she says. ""As long as it gets me to graduate, I'll do it.""

Thompson is no stranger to balancing school and soccer -- whether its weekend trips to tournaments or training camps -- and in October she went one better, making her debut for the US Women's National Team in a friendly against European Champion England in London.

In front of a packed-out Wembley Stadium, Thompson was subbed on for USWNT superstar Megan Rapinoe, a moment that will stay with her for life.

Alyssa Thompson made her debut for the national team as a substitute for Megan Rapinoe.

""That was so crazy! I don't know how to describe it. I was just really nervous, and I was going in for Megan Rapinoe!"" she recalls. ""I don't think I was even processing it in the moment.""

Thompson will have to get used to lining up with the biggest stars in the sport. Angel City boasts a line-up of celebrity owners, including Serena Williams, Natalie Portman, Becky G, Eva Longoria and Mia Hamm.

And the stars are not limited to the sidelines. When the NWSL season kicks off next month, Thompson will be a part of an all-star team featuring two-time world champion Christen Press and Thompson's personal hero Sydney Leroux.

Inspiring on and off the field

Thompson is not only breaking records as the first high school No. 1 draft pick. She also became the first player of Peruvian and Filipino heritage to be picked at No. 1, something that is not lost on her.

Despite her youth, Thompson doesn't simply want to play soccer, but she also wants to be the inspiration for the next generation of girls playing the game.

""I think that being able to be a woman of color just as a role model for little girls is such an amazing thing,"" she tells CNN Sport. ""Being able to look up to someone that looks like them is such a cool thing to have.""

Thompson is used to being a role model having served as one for her younger sisters, Gisele and Zoe, her whole life. Both want to emulate Thompson's success.

Gisele is already on that path after becoming the first high school player, along with Alyssa, to sign a name, image and likeness deal with Nike. She also has emulated her older sister by playing for the USWNT youth teams, featuring at the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup.

Alyssa Thompson will hope make her debut for Angel City next month when the NWSL season kicks off.

The pair have been inseparable, playing together from when they could walk all the way to the present, where they have featured together for the Total Futbol Academy of MLS Next, a boys' team in Southern California.

Despite Thompson's youth, she already sees herself as far more than just an athlete -- someone who has the power to inspire a new generation of soccer players in the US.

""For my youngest sister, Zoe, being able to just be an inspiration for her and a role model for her to look up to, I think has really helped me put things into perspective for what I really want to do and how I want to be a role model for little kids,"" she says.

While making her NSWL debut in Los Angeles is first on Thompson's to-do list, the far bigger prize is in Australia and New Zealand in the shape of the Women's World Cup, which kicks off in July.

Having tasted international senior soccer in October and now training regularly with USWNT players at club level, Thompson is hungry to be a part of the biggest showpiece in women's soccer.

It's a tall order for the young striker. The US boasts the deepest pool of players to choose from of any team and is coming into the tournament as the reigning champion, albeit on a low ebb.

Both of Thompson's appearances for the team came in losses to England and Spain before the US lost to Germany, marking the first time the team has lost three games in a row since 1993.

Head coach Vlatko Andonovski has very little margin for error as he looks to lead the US to a third consecutive title and Thompson will have to seriously impress if she wants to make it onto the plane heading across the Pacific.

""I'm going to do everything that I can to be able to make the roster and I'm just going to work hard towards that goal,"" Thompson says.

""If I continue to grow as a player and continue to thrive in the NWSL environment, then I feel like I have a chance.""

37,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/26/us/aaron-rodgers-darkness-retreat-wellness-ctpr,NFL star Aaron Rodgers went to a darkness retreat to contemplate his future. What is that and how does it work?,"(CNN) For four days this week, home for Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was a pitch-black room. There were no phones, no television, no lights or distractions. Just Rodgers, alone with his thoughts, in a cabin built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark.

When the four-time NFL MVP announced plans earlier this month to contemplate his NFL future in isolation at a ""darkness retreat,"" many were left scratching their heads.

""It's just sitting in isolation, meditation, dealing with your thoughts,"" Rodgers said earlier this month . ""We rarely even turn our phone off or put the blinds down to sleep in darkness. I'm really looking forward to it.""

Rodgers is no stranger to alternative therapies. He credits psychedelics like psilocybin and ayahuasca for helping to alleviate his fear of death and deepening a sense of self-love. The football star said he has done ""many meditation and yoga retreats"" in the past and defended his decision to try darkness therapy as one of several practices ""that have stimulated my mind and helped me get in a better headspace and have a greater peace in my life.""

But what exactly happens in a darkness retreat? And is it just another new-age fad or perhaps something that could benefit the rest of us?

What happens in the dark

A darkness retreat is exactly what it sounds like: a prolonged stay in a space completely devoid of light. One of the centers offering the practice is Sky Cave Retreats , nestled in the Cascade-Siskiyou wilderness, in Southern Oregon, near Klamath Falls.

The cabins are built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark.

""The reasons for doing this range from people wanting to know themselves more, to people who want to rest, reset and relax, to those who want to explore consciousness and deepen their meditation practice,"" said Scott Berman, who owns Sky Cave Retreats along with his wife Jill, adding the darkness helps illuminate what really matters by stripping away the constant bombardment of sensory input and stimulation many people experience in their hectic modern lives.

""When someone goes into the darkness, all these things that were important to them like money, fame, power, status, being worthy -- they all become insignificant and meaningless in the dark,"" Berman said. ""In the dark, all you have is the present moment which reveals what is truly meaningful -- whether it's love, forgiveness, peace -- and it begins to transform you as you truly authentically touch what is most important to you.""

The center currently operates three stand-alone cabins built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark -- earth-sheltered caves, which on the outside are somewhat reminiscent of a Hobbit home. Each space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation. Participants can leave at any time -- the doors are never locked -- and there is a light switch for emergencies which is protected by a childproof guard so it isn't flipped on by accident.

The cost includes three meals a day, which Berman delivers personally all at once in the evening (through a lightproof double-sided food box) to minimize the disturbance. This is when participants have an opportunity for a conversation, which could be 10 seconds or 30 minutes, according to Berman, depending on the person's needs.

Participants typically spend three to four days in the darkness at a cost of $250 a night and are encouraged to take an extra day before and after to integrate the experience.

Each space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation.

Burak Dalcik, a 27-year-old salesman from Arlington, Virginia, said the four days he spent in the dark at Sky Caves Retreats in January gave him clarity about his priorities. He found he no longer labeled experiences as positive or negative, but rather allowed them to come and to go, which led to less stress and anxiety at work and in his personal life. He also said he started calling his mom, who lives back in Turkey, more frequently.

""It just really trims all the unnecessary fat and allows you to focus on some of the most important things and really allows you to understand who you are,"" said Dalcik. ""There's nothing New Age about this -- it boils down to can you just sit by yourself with yourself? And if you can't, you should probably get pretty curious about why.""

Berman cautions the retreat isn't for everyone, nor should it be seen as a quick fix to one's troubles.

""It's not like this magical, mind-blowing, amazing experience -- it can be extremely difficult and uncomfortable,"" Berman said. ""But in the darkness, discomfort is the door to transformation. There's an acceptance and a profound love that people start to experience when they're no longer resisting that part of themselves.""

A therapeutic tool or junk science?

For now, there is limited research on how darkness retreats impact the human brain and body. Some centers claim the experience can help heal traumas or activate the pineal gland, another claim is darkness therapy increases melatonin production in the brain.

""That's totally false,"" said Dr. David Blask, the head of the Laboratory of Chrono-Neuroendocrine Oncology at Tulane University School of Medicine. ""There may be some psychological benefits that people derive from a darkness retreat that they feel are important for them, but certainly not from a strict endocrine neuroendocrine or biochemical physiological standpoint.""

Dr. Marek Malůš, a psychologist at the University of Ostrava in the Czech Republic who has been studying darkness therapies since 2010, sees the technique as a promising therapeutic tool.

""Your thoughts, memories, emotions, inner world and mental processes become much more balanced and integrated,"" Malůš said.

While he and his colleagues are working to secure funding for additional studies, Malůš said preliminary research showed just four days in a darkness chamber was enough to help increase mindfulness and self-esteem, lower symptoms of depression and anxiety, while improving parasympathetic nervous system functions, which helps with stress management and lowering burnout symptoms. Subjects reported feeling the benefits three weeks after the experience.

Berman said he hopes to see more scientific research into the benefits of darkness retreats, but cautions against anyone seeking to use the retreat for some sort of natural high.

""If somebody's coming here because they want to have a so-called DMT experience, you've come into the wrong place,"" he said. ""But there is a lot of benefit in not looking outside of ourselves for confirmation of our worth and using the darkness to illuminate our true nature.""

For those who aren't able to commit the time or money for a darkness retreat but want a taste of some of the benefits, Berman suggests starting small at home.

""It's about becoming accustomed to authentically slowing down, putting the phone away, turning out the lights, closing the blinds and just resting,"" he said. ""Not to get somewhere, not to heal but just to be curious about what's actually happening within yourself.""",['Lucy Kafanov'],2023-02-26

Casemiro broke the deadlock minutes after the half-hour mark, heading home from a Luke Shaw freekick.

Five minutes later, the lead was doubled after Marcus Rashford looked to have continued his electric form when his deflected strike just evaded Lorius Karius to fly into the Newcastle goal despite the German's despairing fingertips -- it was later ruled to be a Sven Botman own goal.

The trophy cements an excellent turnaround under Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag who has transformed the club from perennial underachievers to trophy winners in just over 10 months.

""It's an amazing feeling, we've been searching for this moment, us, the fans, the club, finally we get our trophy, we deserve it,"" Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes told Sky Sports just moments after the final whistle.

""It's been an amazing period. The first trophy of the season but we want more. It's not enough for this club, we want more and we need more because our standards deserve more.""

Turnaround

It was a final longtime coming for both teams for different reasons.

For Manchester United, the club hasn't won a trophy since 2017; a cataclysmic expanse for the club the size of it.

In the black and white of Newcastle, it is an even longer wait, having not won any major silverware for 54 years.

The PIF -- which has an 80% stake in the club, as part of a three-party consortium -- is a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, the man who a US intelligence report named responsible for approving the operation that led to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

With thousands of fans having made the journey down to London from Newcastle for the final, Wembley's atmosphere had a proper cup final feel to it.

And to the delight of Manchester United fans, their local hero and the team's man in form, Rashford, was declared fit to start despite a recent injury scare. Newcastle was without its own star player in goalkeeper Nick Pope who had been shown a red card in his previous game meaning he was suspended.

In the opening few minutes, and in a crackling atmosphere, there was very little between the two teams, with Newcastle's Allan Saint-Maximin going closest after some trademark quick footwork.

When it looked as if Newcastle might be building up a head of steam, it was sucker punched when a free kick from out wide was headed past Karius by Casemiro.

Casemiro celebrates scoring Manchester United's first goal in the Carabao Cup final.

The Brazilian midfielder was signed by manager Ten Hag in a £60 million ($73m) deal from Real Madrid in the summer and his impact as the heart of the team has been indicative of Manchester United's rise since Ten Hag's arrival at the club.

Things went from bad to worse for Newcastle minutes later when some neat link up play between Rashford and Wout Weghorst saw the England star played into the opposition's box. Although he was able to get away a left-footed shot under pressure from Botman, Rashford's shot looked to have been heading wide meaning the goal was credited to the Netherlands defender.

After the halftime break, Newcastle ramped up its pressure on David de Gea's goal, with Saint-Maximin and the newly-introduced Alexander Isak doing their best to fashion goalscoring opportunities.

The final two minutes were filled with set pieces, substitutions and breakaway chances -- with Manchester United actually looking the most likely to score.

In the dying seconds, with the result seemingly wrapped up, Portugal international Fernandes had a glorious opportunity to cap off a memorable afternoon, only for Karius to produce a smart stop.

Rashford celebrates after Manchester United's second goal in the Carabao Cup final.

In the end, Manchester United was able to run down the remainder of the clock, end its six-year trophy wait -- the club's longest wait for a major trophy since 1983 -- and possibly usher in a new era at the club.

""It's a mixture of all the emotions. It's massive for us to be involved in these types of games. it's something we've missed as a club,"" Rashford told Sky Sports afterwards.

""The fact we've come all this way and won it, it's a massive feeling. Hopefully it pushes us now to keep going. There's hunger to add more finals like this. I've been in finals where we've won and lost. It's massive for us as a club and individuals and it's part of our history. We want to keep adding to that.""

He added: ""We want to be involved in a lot of games and that means we've got to stay in the competitions. If we want to win things, we have to keep pushing.""

For Newcastle, it was yet more disappointment at Wembley as it has now lost each of its last nine matches at the stadium, a run that began in the 1974 FA Cup final, extending what is the longest ever losing run by a club side at the venue.",['Ben Morse'],2023-02-26

British reality TV star Tommy Fury (C) celebrates after his split decision win against US YouTuber Jake Paul.

Paul, a 26-year-old American with more than 20 million YouTube subscribers, is now 6-1 while Fury, the British younger half-brother of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury , remains undefeated with nine wins after taking time out of his boxing career in 2019 to star in reality show ""Love Island.""

Millions of fans were expected to tune into the fight, the latest pay-per-view bout involving a YouTuber to generate a social media buzz as promoters played up the bad blood between the two fighters. And just like a genuine world title fight, there were plenty of stars ringside, including former champ Mike Tyson, soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and comedian Kevin Hart.

Fury asserted his jab early to keep Paul at a distance but the YouTuber gained momentum in the fifth round, appearing to stun Fury.

Both had points deducted -- Paul in the fifth for pushing his opponent's head down while clinching and Fury in the sixth for too much clinching, a defensive tactic that's often only allowed for short periods of time.

Mike Tyson is seen before the fight in Riyadh's Diriyah Arena, Saudi Arabia.

Fury was knocked down in the eighth round on a short-left hand by Paul but it was too late as the judges ruled in Fury's favor.

Now, he wants to open the door for more people to come out","(CNN) During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with ""the best right shoulder in the game,"" according to one of his former coaches.

He played three times for the All Blacks -- a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand -- and represented club teams at home and overseas.

But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.

""I loved playing rugby,"" he tells CNN Sport . ""And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.

""That didn't fit the picture and that wasn't part of my plan. I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn't address it -- just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.""

Last month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.

The response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for ""blazing this trail"" and inspiring ""future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.""

""So many people have sent messages of support,"" says Johnstone. ""Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.

""In that respect, it's been really overwhelming and so positive.""

Johnstone played for the Ospreys in Wales, as well as clubs in New Zealand and France.

On top of his three Tests for the All Blacks in 2005, Johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for Canterbury and 38 times for the Crusaders. He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.

Now, the 43-year-old says he is ""at peace"" in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn't believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.

""It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,"" says Johnstone. ""Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn't be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.

""I'd go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I'd go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I'd come home and realize that I'm not actually being truthful to my teammates.""

Former referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.

Both Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer , who came out as gay in 2020, said he ""routinely numbed"" himself with a ""heavy cocktail of opioids"" during his playing career.

But Johnstone is optimistic about rugby's future.

""As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it'll progress very well,"" he says.

""I think rugby is a living culture and it's always progressing and it's progressing in the right directions.""

Johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days -- largely because he's always been a private person and ""wasn't 100% comfortable"" with his sexuality at the time.

He's now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.

""I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: 'Yeah, okay, let's address it and take away that stigma,' because there's always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.

""If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.""

After retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.

He recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team -- something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.

""That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,"" says Johnstone, ""and you'll get better results, I believe.""",['George Ramsay'],2023-02-23

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible ""sabotage,"" saying the IBA had announced a ""false and misleading"" qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women's and men's world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

Andy Cruz of Team Cuba dodges a punch from Keyshawn Davis of Team USA during the men's lightweight final at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA's running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the ""ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.""

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to ""come together and work together as a unit"" so it can ""continue to fight for our Olympic future.""

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be ""fundamental change"" before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body's decision was ""taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.""

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA's ""financial dependency"" on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the ""continuing and very concerning issues"" over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been ""dealing with significant governance issues,"" which it said were a ""burden from the past leadership.""

""We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC's upper echelon,"" the statement added.

""This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.""

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women's and men's world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be ""main qualification events"" for Paris 2024.

The IBA's announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation's banners -- or competing in general -- in many sports following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin's troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as ""neutral athletes.""

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other ""like-minded"" countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries -- including the UK, Canada and most of Europe -- said in a joint statement that there is ""no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.""

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the ""Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.""

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to ""use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.""

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

(Left to right) Silver medalist Pat McCormack, gold medalist Cuba's Roniel Iglesias and bronze medalists Russian Olympic Committee's Andrei Zamkovoi and Ireland's Aidan Walsh celebrate on the podium after the men's welterweight boxing final at the 2020 Olympics.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA's announcement, saying ""the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024's boxing qualifications and tournament.""

The statement said the IBA's suspension was ""still in force"" and that ""the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.""

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA's announcement of qualifying tournaments ""totally unacceptable"" and said it ""clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.""

""IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,"" he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained ""committed to the Olympic movement"" by following the IOC's principles of ""proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.""

On Wednesday, Ukraine's boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA's world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men's and women's championships.

""Our answer is clear -- our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,"" Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

Ilchenko added: ""As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country ... they will not participate.""",['Ben Morse'],2023-02-24

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

""I enjoy those moments in the game when I'm just going after people,"" the NBA All-Star said after the game. ""That's all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.""

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell's 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting -- even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts -- just one off Klay Thompson's record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard's teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell's total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

""It really, really was a masterful performance,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star's game. ""It was a piece of art. That was incredible.""

Any postgame celebrations for Lillard were cut short after he was picked for a drug test.

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain's record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

""I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you're hot, you're in attack mode, you're feeling good,"" he said.

Not only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.

The Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.

Now, Palestinian national team wants a slice of the action at 2026 tournament","(CNN) The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory's presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting ""free Palestine,"" while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel's creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel's capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel's creation -- in what Palestinians call the ""Nakba"" and Israelis call Independence Day -- clashes have been frequent.

Rami Hamadeh plays for the Palestianian national team against Jordan at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, AFC Asian Cup.

""Nakba"" means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

""The Israeli occupation doesn't just affect me, but affects ... Palestinian sports in general,"" the Palestinian team's goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

""Whether it's players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.""

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian football player Mahmoud Sarsak, who staged a hunger strike of nearly three months while in Israeli jail, is surrounded by relatives and supporters at the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on July 10, 2012 upon his release from prison.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel's ""illegal combatant"" policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said ""I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.""

But last year's AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

""The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It's the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,"" the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes' movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was ""clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.""

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

Makram Daboub (C) became the Palestinian national team's official coach in 2021.

The politics of travel

Nicknamed the ""Lions of Canaan"" and the ""Fedayeen,"" the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

""Our training base is in the West Bank, and I'm able to watch the matches here. But I can't watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can't come to the West Bank either,"" said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

""Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,"" Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, ""Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.""

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team's official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

""We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,"" said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer's world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won't be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

Morocco's Ismail El Haddad and Palestinian Yaser Hamed contest the ball in an Arab Cup game in December 2021.

""I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,"" said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

'Love of football'

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup -- the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages -- Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

""When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it's from the Palestinian bloodline,"" Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain's national football team if he's called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

""I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I'm proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It's like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,"" said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

The PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad's first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players' health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

""To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,"" said Shaheen.

""The nutritional support that's added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,"" Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been ""shining"" in the Portuguese league.

Oday Dabbagh, who plays club football in Portugal, is pictured playing for the Palestinian national team against Song Kum Song of North Korea during the 2018 AFC Under-23 Championship in Jiangyin city, east China's Jiangsu province, in January 2018.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA -- he plays for Portugal's F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team's future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn't always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel's control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association's (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn't violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its ""FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.""

Additionally, FIFA's football infrastructure projects ""include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,"" according to FIFA.

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, back right, and President of the Palestine Olympic Committee Jibril Rajoub, second right, back, meet with young Palestinian athletes at Faisal Al-Husseini stadium in the West Bank city of Al-Ram, north of Jerusalem, in September 2022.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces ""won't stop us from our plans.""

""This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,"" said Hilal.

""There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it's known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,"" Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn't hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.

While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.

""There's a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,"" said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

""For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,""

52,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/football/super-league-documentary-football-jeff-zimbalist-spt-intl,A 'political thriller' filled with personal betrayals. The inside story of the Super League and the war for soccer's soul,"(CNN) Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming -- just ask Julius Caesar, who asked ""Et tu Brute?"" as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition -- the Champions League -- are akin to a 'House of Cards' plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe's biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body's UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams -- the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary ""Super League: The War for Football,"" the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a ""political thriller ... 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,"" its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles -- or its future -- and, most stingingly of all, ""betrayal"" between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter's godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was ""sort of the general of the opposing army,"" Zimbalist says.

""The dynamics at play here aren't that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,"" he adds. ""The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.""

Aleksander Čeferin was elected UEFA President in 2016.

Characters -- normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews -- are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother's death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez's about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi's about his tennis playing days.

""This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,"" Zimbalist says. ""These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

""We were watching what's usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.""

'Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?'

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs -- all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to ""drop a legislative bomb"" to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

Andrea Agnelli was replaced by Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the chairman of the European Club Association.

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects' reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

""That was how we presented it to them,"" Zimbalist says.

""We're going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they're rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.""

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

""You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,"" he says. ""But then you're leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.""

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport's most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football's magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

Real Madrid won the 2022 Champions League.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

""This identity crisis in the sport -- is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?"" Zimbalist says. ""If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn't fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.""

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the ""cynical project,"" as seemingly, did football's world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA's more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

'The war for football rages on'

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with ""60 to 80 teams"" earlier this month.

Zimbalist's documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by ""old money"" clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by ""new money"" club such as PSG and Manchester City.

""We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,"" he says.

""And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?""

Giorgio Marchetti is the Deputy General Secretary of UEFA.

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team's representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors -- including Agnelli -- resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor's office in Turin.

Barcelona's already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become ""a reality in 2025.""

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN's Richard Quest last month that for them, ""the Super League is in the past.""

""It was something that we apologized for and ... going forward, it's not something that we're interested in.""

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league's fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the ""ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,"" Zimbalist says.

""Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.""",['Issy Ronald'],2023-02-27

Whether they are memorable for the right reasons is another debate entirely. While Payne Stewart's sartorial elegance and seemingly bottomless wardrobe of knickers saw his fashion reputation transcend golf, there was also the wearable eyesore that was Team USA's 1999 Ryder Cup outfit -- so bad that Tiger Woods confessed to burning it for warmth.

""Sportswashing"" refers to governments using high-profile sporting events to project a favorable image of their country around the world, often to draw attention away from alleged wrongdoing.

""Despite horrific human rights records, both states enjoy generous F1 contracts and exploit the F1 platform to sanitize their image on the world stage, while thousands of political prisoners languish behind bars,"" Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, BIRD's Advocacy Director, said in a statement commenting on the letter on Monday.

55,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/16/sport/lesley-paterson-all-quiet-on-the-western-front-film-triathlon-spt-intl,How a world champion triathlete earned an Oscar nomination,"(CNN) It's while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.

A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.

She counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.

The film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer -- a young army recruit and the story's protagonist -- notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.

Unbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.

""It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film -- that the uniform's more important than the man,"" Paterson tells CNN Sport

""It's just one of those moments where you know it's good and you think: 'Oh my God ... where did this come from?' You feel so lucky that you've thought of it.""

The scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment

""If we can hold up a mirror to what's going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller -- to effect change,"" says Paterson.

Felix Kammerer stars as Paul Bäumer in ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""

First portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, ""All Quiet"" focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.

Paterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.

The end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world's first mechanized war in chilling detail.

It has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations -- including for best adapted screenplay -- and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations

The BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 -- two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.

A five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.

That was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.

With the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.

""I do a lot of one-arm drills,"" says Paterson. ""I was always really good at it and I've got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: 'Well, I can do one arm, let's give this a shot.'""

After finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.

""I just kind of kept on going,"" she says. ""And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.""

Triathlete Lesley Paterson competes for Great Britain in Birmingham, Alabama, in 2012.

The experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.

""I don't know if that's the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it's just truly I'm driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,"" she says. ""I'm a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.""

Paterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series -- ""all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,"" she says -- having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.

After she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in -- and winning -- races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get ""All Quiet"" off the ground.

""Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it's a lot of money,"" says Paterson.

""Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn't necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.""

Over the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she's doing and an obsessive attention to detail.

""I've always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,"" says Paterson.

""People think they are often very separate, but they're actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I'd say that I truly am the athlete I am because I'm an artist and the artist I am because I'm an athlete.""

""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed.

Whether it's sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of ""looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.""

It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 -- the only girl in a team of boys -- and why she chose to tackle ""All Quiet"" at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.

The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes' ""1917"" four years ago.

And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching ""All Quiet"" in German, rather than English.

""There's an authenticity -- it's their story, it's their national novel, it's rightly so that it's in German,"" says Paterson.

The popularity of ""All Quiet"" may take Paterson's life in a different direction, especially now that she's 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.

Whatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.

""It's focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes -- that was a huge learning curve for me,"" she says.

""As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you're at ... That's where the beauty comes.""",['George Ramsay'],2023-02-16

Because not just once, but twice during his third round, American golfer Akshay Bhatia was forced into an impromptu wardrobe change at the PGA National Resort in Palm Beach, Florida.

The first came at the sixth hole, when the 21-year-old's tee drive settled in the muddy banks on the left of the fairway. A shirtless shot followed as Bhatia successfully scooped his ball back onto the fairway, the splashes of mud across his chest suggesting that the shirt removal was a smart decision.

A superb approach and putt saw the world No. 357 save par superbly, yet despite the best efforts of his caddie and a towel, the hole had left its mark on Bhatia. Fortunately, his girlfriend was on hand with a change of clothes, and the golfer pushed on with his round.

Bhatia tracks his shot from the sixth hole.

Bhatia had been riding the wave of an excellent second round, but effectively saw any chance of a first PGA Tour victory collapse across four holes. A run of bogey, par, double bogey and bogey saw Bhatia arrive at the par-three 15th hole needing a big response, only for his tee shot to sail over the flag and into the swampy area behind the green.

Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday, that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind.

A nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American's fifth PGA Tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.

""I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety,"" Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort.

""I wouldn't be doing this for a living anymore. I probably wouldn't have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.

""For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.

""It's something that's constantly on my mind, so it's pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.""

Kirk during the final round.

'I got sober because of you'

On the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019, Kirk announced he would be taking an ""indefinite leave"" from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.

""I thought I could control it, but after multiple relapses, I have come to realize I can't fix this on my own,"" Kirk added in a social media post.

By that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.

A tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk's sole top-40 finish of the campaign.

When he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further -- he was world No. 303 -- but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.

candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer's previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.

Kirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to ""accelerate"" his alcohol issues.

For Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.

Kirk is congratulated by his caddie after victory.

""It's been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, 'I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],"" Kirk said.

""When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more ... for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.

""So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.

""But now on the back end a little bit, it's been amazing. Like I said, it's not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and ... for somebody to say, 'I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,' you can't really describe how unreal that is with words.""

Augusta calling

On Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.

The American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot -- ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event -- who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.

For both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.

Again, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.

When Cole's birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip's hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.

As well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday's triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.

""I've been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that's going to be something that's incredibly special,"" Kirk said.

""That par-3 contest can't come soon enough. I'm really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.""

On Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.

""It'll be a lot of celebrating, and I thank God that alcohol won't be a part of it,"" Kirk said.",['Jack Bantock'],2023-02-27
60,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/16/sport/lesley-paterson-all-quiet-on-the-western-front-film-triathlon-spt-intl,How a world champion triathlete earned an Oscar nomination,"(CNN) It's while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.

A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.

She counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.

The film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer -- a young army recruit and the story's protagonist -- notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.

Unbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.

""It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film -- that the uniform's more important than the man,"" Paterson tells CNN Sport

""It's just one of those moments where you know it's good and you think: 'Oh my God ... where did this come from?' You feel so lucky that you've thought of it.""

The scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment

""If we can hold up a mirror to what's going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller -- to effect change,"" says Paterson.

Felix Kammerer stars as Paul Bäumer in ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""

First portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, ""All Quiet"" focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.

Paterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.

The end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world's first mechanized war in chilling detail.

It has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations -- including for best adapted screenplay -- and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations

The BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 -- two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.

A five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.

That was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.

With the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.

""I do a lot of one-arm drills,"" says Paterson. ""I was always really good at it and I've got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: 'Well, I can do one arm, let's give this a shot.'""

After finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.

""I just kind of kept on going,"" she says. ""And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.""

Triathlete Lesley Paterson competes for Great Britain in Birmingham, Alabama, in 2012.

The experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.

""I don't know if that's the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it's just truly I'm driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,"" she says. ""I'm a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.""

Paterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series -- ""all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,"" she says -- having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.

After she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in -- and winning -- races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get ""All Quiet"" off the ground.

""Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it's a lot of money,"" says Paterson.

""Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn't necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.""

Over the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she's doing and an obsessive attention to detail.

""I've always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,"" says Paterson.

""People think they are often very separate, but they're actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I'd say that I truly am the athlete I am because I'm an artist and the artist I am because I'm an athlete.""

""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed.

Whether it's sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of ""looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.""

It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 -- the only girl in a team of boys -- and why she chose to tackle ""All Quiet"" at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.

The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes' ""1917"" four years ago.

And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching ""All Quiet"" in German, rather than English.

""There's an authenticity -- it's their story, it's their national novel, it's rightly so that it's in German,"" says Paterson.

The popularity of ""All Quiet"" may take Paterson's life in a different direction, especially now that she's 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.

Whatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.

""It's focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes -- that was a huge learning curve for me,"" she says.

""As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you're at ... That's where the beauty comes.""",['George Ramsay'],2023-02-16

62,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/football/super-league-documentary-football-jeff-zimbalist-spt-intl,A 'political thriller' filled with personal betrayals. The inside story of the Super League and the war for soccer's soul,"(CNN) Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming -- just ask Julius Caesar, who asked ""Et tu Brute?"" as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition -- the Champions League -- are akin to a 'House of Cards' plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe's biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body's UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams -- the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary ""Super League: The War for Football,"" the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a ""political thriller ... 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,"" its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles -- or its future -- and, most stingingly of all, ""betrayal"" between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter's godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was ""sort of the general of the opposing army,"" Zimbalist says.

""The dynamics at play here aren't that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,"" he adds. ""The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.""

Aleksander Čeferin was elected UEFA President in 2016.

Characters -- normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews -- are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother's death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez's about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi's about his tennis playing days.

""This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,"" Zimbalist says. ""These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

""We were watching what's usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.""

'Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?'

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs -- all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to ""drop a legislative bomb"" to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

Andrea Agnelli was replaced by Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the chairman of the European Club Association.

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects' reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

""That was how we presented it to them,"" Zimbalist says.

""We're going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they're rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.""

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

""You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,"" he says. ""But then you're leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.""

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport's most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football's magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

Real Madrid won the 2022 Champions League.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

""This identity crisis in the sport -- is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?"" Zimbalist says. ""If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn't fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.""

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the ""cynical project,"" as seemingly, did football's world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA's more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

'The war for football rages on'

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with ""60 to 80 teams"" earlier this month.

Zimbalist's documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by ""old money"" clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by ""new money"" club such as PSG and Manchester City.

""We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,"" he says.

""And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?""

Giorgio Marchetti is the Deputy General Secretary of UEFA.

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team's representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors -- including Agnelli -- resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor's office in Turin.

Barcelona's already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become ""a reality in 2025.""

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN's Richard Quest last month that for them, ""the Super League is in the past.""

""It was something that we apologized for and ... going forward, it's not something that we're interested in.""

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league's fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the ""ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,"" Zimbalist says.

""Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.""",['Issy Ronald'],2023-02-27
63,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/02/sport/nfl-scouting-combine-2023-preview-spt-intl,2023 NFL scouting combine: Everything you need to know,"(CNN) It's that time of year when hope is plentiful and everything looks a bit brighter.

Yes, it is the beginning of spring , but it is also the start of the NFL offseason whose first major event is the scouting combine.

The showpiece stage for draft hopefuls welcomes the beginning of prediction season and marks when last year's disappointments change into this year's reasons for optimism.

Stars can solidify their status at the top while unheralded prospects can surprise everyone with their athletic displays; it is impossible to predict what will happen when this year's standout college players are put through their paces at the invitation-only affair.

So before the biggest event for teams to evaluate players ahead of next month's draft in Kansas City, here's all you need to know about this year's combine:

How to watch

The NFL scouting combine is the pinnacle for many prospects hoping to be drafted into the professional league so they will be aiming to impress on the biggest stage.

Coverage of the scouting combine is exclusively shown on the NFL Network, which will broadcast all four days.

'The ultimate four-day job interview'

As is tradition, this year's combine is held in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis -- the home of the Indianapolis Colts.

Having begun in 1982 when Indianapolis-based National Football Scouting Inc. (NFS) conducted the first National Invitational Camp in Florida, it has blossomed from hosting 163 players in its inaugural edition to over 300 expected this year -- the NFL said that 319 prospects were invited.

Representatives from all 32 NFL teams will be in attendance -- from front office staff and coaches to scouts.

It is held over four days from Thursday, March 2, to Sunday, March 5, with each position group getting their own dedicated portion to showcase their skill sets in front of the watching media and NFL teams.

Defensive linemen and linebackers begin proceedings on Thursday before defensive backs try their hand on Friday.

The weekend begins with arguably the most important day, with quarterbacks, wide receivers and tight ends displaying their talent Saturday before running backs and offensive lineman close out the combine on Sunday.

Not only will teams be able to watch players be put through their paces, but they will also have the opportunity to interview them in an effort to build out a more complete draft profile, including personality and psychological notes, before making a decision on whether they want to draft them.

Players will also be subjected to medical examinations to allow teams to avoid injury complications down the line.

A full test

The tests the prospects will be put through are aimed at challenging their repertoire of physical capabilities to help teams evaluate the whole package.

The most notable event is the 40-yard dash which sees prospects sprint the distance to display their top speed.

John Ross set the record with the fastest 40-yard time in 2017, running 4.22 seconds. Last year, it looked like Ross' record might have been broken when Baylor's Tyquan Thornton ran an unofficial time of 4.21 seconds -- it was later made official with a time of 4.28 seconds.

Ross runs the 40-yard dash in a record time of 4.22 seconds in 2017.

Thornton's Baylor teammate, Kalon Barnes, was just slower with a time of 4.23 seconds. UTSA's Tariq Woolen, who would go on to be voted to the Pro Bowl after his first season with the Seattle Seahawks, ran 4.26 seconds.

It's unlikely Ross' record will be broken, but there are some serious speedsters taking to the running track in Indianapolis who could threaten him.

Other physical drills include a bench press -- where players bench press 225 pounds as many times as possible -- a vertical jump and a broad jump.

The final drills -- the three-cone drill, 20-yard shuttle and the 60-yard shuttle -- are all designed to test an athlete's quickness and agility, as they must rush between various points before making short and sharp turns of direction before sprinting in opposite directions.

All in all, it is described on the official NFL website as the ""ultimate four-day job interview"" with it holding the possibility of catapulting up the draft list or severely hampering one's stock.

The Chicago Bears currently hold the No. 1 overall pick in April's draft, with the Houston Texans second and the Arizona Cardinals in third.

Balling out

The biggest names in college football have been invited to the combine this year, with teams and fans alike thrilled at the opportunity to watch them strut their stuff.

The quarterbacks which are expected to be selected near the top of the draft -- Bryce Young, CJ Stroud, Will Levis and Anthony Richardson -- will be in attendance, although Alabama star Young has reportedly chosen not to thrown, instead choosing to wait for his school's specific pro-day later in the month.

Young celebrates after receiving the Sugar Bowl MVP award on December 31, 2022.

Many of the other prospects predicted to go near the top of the draft will be in attendance too.

Alabama edge rusher Will Anderson Jr., Texas running back Bijan Robinson, Illinois corner back Devon Witherspoon, Northwestern offensive tackle Peter Skoronski, Texas Tech edge rusher Tyree Wilson, Georgia Tech edge rusher Keion White, Utah tight end Dalton Kincaid and USC wide receiver Jordan Addison are just some of the names on the list.

Witherspoon celebrates after the Illinois Fighting Illini beat the Chattanooga Mocs on September 22, 2022.

One of the players who was scheduled to work out but will not now is University of Georgia standout Jalen Carter after he surrendered to police in Athens, Georgia, on Wednesday night on charges related to a crash that killed his teammate and a team staffer hours after they celebrated the Bulldogs' national championship victory.

Carter -- who has been projected as a top pick in the NFL draft next month -- turned himself in at the Athens-Clarke County Jail on charges of reckless driving and racing, jail records show. He was booked at 11:33 p.m. and released a short time later at 11:49 p.m.

Carter's teammate Devin Willock and football team staff member Chandler LeCroy were killed in the January 15 crash, which happened hours after the team participated in a parade through the UGA campus to celebrate its second consecutive national title.

LeCroy was driving a Ford SUV near the campus with Willock and two other members of the football program also in the vehicle, police have said. The SUV was traveling ""about 104 miles per hour"" before it veered off the road and slammed into two power poles and several trees, Athens-Clarke County police said.

Authorities said Carter was driving a separate vehicle and he and LeCroy appeared to be racing.

According to reports from ESPN's Adam Schefter and NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Carter returned to the NFL combine facilities on Thursday to finish his interviews, measurements and other activities.",['Ben Morse'],2023-03-02
64,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/02/sport/brian-flores-judge-lawsuit-nfl-spt-intl,"Brian Flores' racial discrimination lawsuit against NFL and multiple teams can proceed, judge says","(CNN) Former Miami Dolphins head coach and current Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores' lawsuit against the NFL and three teams -- the Denver Broncos, the New York Giants and the Houston Texans -- can proceed instead of going to arbitration, a federal judge said on Wednesday.

Judge Valerie Caproni issued the decision, allowing Flores to pursue his case against the three teams and the NFL through a court, though his suit against the Miami Dolphins and both Steve Wilks' and Ray Horton's cases will go through arbitration.

""This case shines an unflattering spotlight on the employment practices of National Football League (""NFL"") teams. Although the clear majority of professional football players are Black, only a tiny percentage of coaches are Black,"" Caproni wrote in her decision.

Flores' attorney Doug Wigdor said in a statement: ""We are pleased that Coach Flores' class claims of systematic discrimination against the NFL and several teams will proceed in court and ultimately before a jury of his peers.""

Last year, Flores, who had recently been fired by the Miami Dolphins after three seasons as head coach, filed a federal civil lawsuit, alleging racial discrimination in the hiring practices for head coaching jobs.

Flores alleged in the suit that Dolphins' owner Stephen Ross offered to pay him to purposely lose games in order to secure a higher pick in the NFL draft and encouraged him to purposely violate league tampering rules.

When he refused, Ross then led a campaign to treat Flores with ""disdain and held out as someone who was noncompliant and difficult to work with,"" the lawsuit states.

The Dolphins didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment, though when Flores initiated his lawsuit just over a year ago the NFL team said: ""We vehemently deny any allegations of racial discrimination and are proud of the diversity and inclusion throughout our organization.""

""The implication that we acted in a manner inconsistent with the integrity of the game is incorrect.""

Flores also accused the Giants and Broncos of carrying out sham interviews in order to comply with the ""Rooney Rule,"" which requires teams to interview at least two minority candidates for open head coaching jobs.

Last month he was hired by the Minnesota Vikings as a defensive coordinator after spending last season as senior defensive assistant/linebackers coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers, which was noted by the Judge Caproni.

In her ruling, she also noted the league's ""long history of systematic discrimination toward Black players, coaches, and managers -- are incredibly troubling.""

""Given the number of Black men who play and coach football, it is difficult to understand how it could be that, at the time Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit, 'the NFL had only one Black Head Coach.'""

The Giants declined to comment, while CNN Sport has reached out to the Broncos and Texans for comment.

NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy said in a statement to CNN: ""Diversity and inclusion throughout the NFL make us a better organization. We recognize there is more work to be done and we are deeply committed to doing it.

""That said, we are pleased with the court's decision, which correctly holds that the vast majority of claims in this case are properly arbitrable by the Commissioner under binding agreements signed by each plaintiff.

""We intend to move forward promptly with arbitrations as directed by the court and will seek to dismiss the remaining claims.""

Dodd, who previously led Fifa's taskforce on women's football, wrote on Linkedin: ""[W]hen a girl plays football, the world sees her differently. Instead of being complimented on her nice looks or her pretty dress, she is valued for her game-saving tackles and brilliant goal-scoring.

""She's admired for what she can DO, rather than how she looks, putting her on a more equal footing with her brothers in a way that can alter the whole trajectory of her life's ambitions.

Hamlin collapsed after making a tackle in a game between the Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals on January 2.

Doctors and trainers administered CPR and used a defibrillator on the field to resuscitate him, after which he was transferred to medical centers in Cincinnati and Buffalo before being released on January 11.

The cause of the cardiac arrest, which meant Hamlin's heart abruptly stopped beating, has not been determined.

On Tuesday, Beane said Hamlin is ""doing great"" as he continues his recovery but needs full medical clearance if he wants to play again.

If the PGA Tour's revamped 2024 schedule succeeds in pitting the golf's major stars against one another more regularly, the sport's latest rivalries could be about to get more showings.

The new schedule offers increased prize purses, smaller fields, and no cuts, much like the breakaway LIV Golf Series

""It is more opportunity for the top players to battle it out late on Sundays,"" world No. 8 Max Homa told reporters.

""Which, you look back at times of Phil and Tiger, the two best players growing up for me watching, and they had like maybe two real battles. So we're going to have more of that.""

World No. 3 Rory McIlroy is another supporter of the revamp, describing as it as ""trying to get the top guys vs. the hot guys.""

Unveiled by PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan in a letter to the Tour's membership, the new schedule will include eight ""designated events"" made up of between 70 and 78 players.

Eligibility criteria, as well as which events are to be marked as ""designated,"" are set to be specified at a later date, a press release from the Tour said.

However, it added that the ""framework"" for eligibility will ""reward top performers"" on the Tour -- including the top 50 players from the previous year's FedEx Cup rankings, the top-30 PGA Tour players in the world rankings, and tournament winners during the season.

And with no 36-hole cut line, all golfers competing will play the entirety of the events that offer elevated purses, as well as FedEx Cup points.

Though involvement will not be mandatory, these two factors, as well as the competitiveness and ""prestige"" of the tournaments, will ""incentivize"" participation, the Tour added.

""These smaller, Designated event fields will not only deliver substantial, can't-miss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season, but they will also enhance the quality of Full-Field events,"" Monahan said in the letter to players.

""Together, this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive, compelling, consequential and with clarity for fans, players and sponsors alike.""

The new scheduling will not affect the majors, The Players Championship, as well as three FedEx Cup Playoff events. Their existing format is set to remain unchanged, with designated events run in addition.

'Imitation is the greatest form of flattery'

Designated events were first announced by the PGA Tour last August, with 12 on the 2023 schedule. The first on this season's calendar was the Phoenix Open in February, as Scottie Scheffler secured $3.6 million in prize money.

Though still including a cut line, the increased purses at these tournaments were offered as a response to the emergence of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Series last year.

Bankrolled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), LIV Golf offered huge amounts of money for players to leave the established tours -- the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour -- to join the new series.

PIF pledged to award $250 million in total prize money for the tour's inaugural season. Of the $25 million prizes purses offered at each of the first seven events, $20 million was a guaranteed split between players. Played across three rounds as opposed to the typical four, golfers could not be cut as part of a team-based format.

""Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Congratulations PGA Tour. Welcome to the future,"" read a tweet from LIV Golf's official account Wednesday.

The inaugural LIV Golf event was hosted at Centurion Club in St Albans, England in June 2022.

Ahead of the PGA Tour's Arnold Palmer Invitational this week, a host of its big-name golfers were quizzed on their views about the revamped schedule.

Consistently outspoken against LIV Golf, accusing it of ""ripping apart"" men's professional golf, McIlroy has previously been dubbed the de-facto spokesperson for the PGA Tour.

Asked whether the new schedule's restricted eligibility criteria could leave lower-ranked golfers ""on the outside looking in,"" the four-time major champion said he was firmly behind the new plans.

""I love it,"" McIlroy told reporters Wednesday. ""Obviously I've been a part of it and been in a ton of discussions. I think it makes the TOUR more competitive.

""I'm all about rewarding good play. I want to give everyone a fair shake at this. Which I think this structure has done. There's ways to play into it.

When Scheffler was asked whether designated events were threatening to create a ""closed shop,"" the world No. 2 said: ""I think it's exciting because you're going to have the top guys in the world playing against each other more often.

""You're going to be able to guarantee the sponsors that those guys are going to be there four days. I think that's a lot of value added to TV and for sponsors.

""I think it's a better model overall for the Tour to have a set of events that are aspirational and that give guys access to those events.

""If you earn your way in to those events, the top 50 in the FedExCup this year gets into all of 'em ... I think it's more of a reward for the guys that are playing the best on the Tour.""

McIlroy discussed his thoughts on the new schedule on Wednesday.

Scheffler: Money not a factor

Discussing the increased spotlight on prize purses, Scheffler insisted that money was not a ""motivating factor"" for players on the PGA Tour.

""We get paid a ridiculous amount of money to do what we do out here, but I don't think money is the motivating factor for too many guys,"" Scheffler said.

""You can't really base life decisions when it comes to money. When you're out here playing golf tournaments you're never thinking about the money, you just want to win the tournament.

""So as being kind of a golf purist, that's the motivation. I want to be able to play well, win tournaments and get the most out of my game.""

In response to the absence of a cut line at designated events, McIlroy highlighted the absence of cuts at various existing PGA Tour events -- including the CJ Cup and the Zozo Championship -- as proof there is a ""precedent"" for the format.

""The only reason no-cut events are a big deal is because LIV has come along ... There's been no-cut events since I've been a member of the TOUR and way beyond that as well,"" McIlroy said.

""It keeps the stars there for four days. You ask Mastercard or whoever it is to pay 20 million dollars for a golf event, they want to see the stars at the weekend. They want a guarantee that the stars are there. So if that's what needs to happen, then that's what happens.""

Homa's 'rant'

Perhaps the most impassioned defense of the new scheduling however, came from Homa, who warned he could ""rant on this for awhile"" regarding the changes as the 32-year-old American delivered a four four-minute monologue.

While he understood ""gripes"" around the limited fields, Homa said that discussions with Monahan had confirmed his belief that the plans were positive for the game.

""I think it's easy to frame these changes as a way to put more money in the top players' pockets, but it has been made to make it easier and more fun for the fans,"" said Homa.

Addressing concerns over restricted fields, Homa highlighted the example of an unnamed golfer who had become a ""running joke"" due to his participation in a PGA Tour event. According to Homa, the player was a professional golfer but was no longer a practicing pro.

""Those people will be in a ton of the events,"" he said.

Homa in action during the pro-am prior to the Arnold Palmer Invitational.

""Now the sponsors have to say, 'Well do we want ... a chunk of the field [being] guys that won an event years and years ago that have jobs or have retired well before that,"" added Homa.

""It is a major in a way or a major field every single week.

""So I think it will be a new and improved challenge. I think it's important that we all test each other against one another each week. If you don't, you will get pushed aside and have to work your way back up.

""It will be a different kind of stress that we haven't had before, but I do think it will be stressful.""

Asked if he wanted a break before continuing with the rest of his press conference, Homa declined, quipping: ""Sorry guys. I think a lot and you just heard my brain spill out.""",['Jack Bantock'],2023-03-02

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

""I enjoy those moments in the game when I'm just going after people,"" the NBA All-Star said after the game. ""That's all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.""

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell's 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting -- even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts -- just one off Klay Thompson's record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard's teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell's total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

""It really, really was a masterful performance,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star's game. ""It was a piece of art. That was incredible.""

Any postgame celebrations for Lillard were cut short after he was picked for a drug test.

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain's record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

""I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you're hot, you're in attack mode, you're feeling good,"" he said.

Not only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.

The Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.

Now, he wants to open the door for more people to come out","(CNN) During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with ""the best right shoulder in the game,"" according to one of his former coaches.

He played three times for the All Blacks -- a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand -- and represented club teams at home and overseas.

But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.

""I loved playing rugby,"" he tells CNN Sport . ""And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.

""That didn't fit the picture and that wasn't part of my plan. I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn't address it -- just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.""

Last month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.

The response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for ""blazing this trail"" and inspiring ""future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.""

""So many people have sent messages of support,"" says Johnstone. ""Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.

""In that respect, it's been really overwhelming and so positive.""

Johnstone played for the Ospreys in Wales, as well as clubs in New Zealand and France.

On top of his three Tests for the All Blacks in 2005, Johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for Canterbury and 38 times for the Crusaders. He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.

Now, the 43-year-old says he is ""at peace"" in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn't believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.

""It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,"" says Johnstone. ""Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn't be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.

""I'd go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I'd go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I'd come home and realize that I'm not actually being truthful to my teammates.""

Former referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.

Both Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer , who came out as gay in 2020, said he ""routinely numbed"" himself with a ""heavy cocktail of opioids"" during his playing career.

But Johnstone is optimistic about rugby's future.

""As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it'll progress very well,"" he says.

""I think rugby is a living culture and it's always progressing and it's progressing in the right directions.""

Johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days -- largely because he's always been a private person and ""wasn't 100% comfortable"" with his sexuality at the time.

He's now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.

""I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: 'Yeah, okay, let's address it and take away that stigma,' because there's always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.

""If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.""

After retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.

He recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team -- something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible ""sabotage,"" saying the IBA had announced a ""false and misleading"" qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women's and men's world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

Andy Cruz of Team Cuba dodges a punch from Keyshawn Davis of Team USA during the men's lightweight final at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA's running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the ""ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.""

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to ""come together and work together as a unit"" so it can ""continue to fight for our Olympic future.""

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be ""fundamental change"" before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body's decision was ""taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.""

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA's ""financial dependency"" on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the ""continuing and very concerning issues"" over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been ""dealing with significant governance issues,"" which it said were a ""burden from the past leadership.""

""We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC's upper echelon,"" the statement added.

""This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.""

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women's and men's world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be ""main qualification events"" for Paris 2024.

The IBA's announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation's banners -- or competing in general -- in many sports following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin's troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as ""neutral athletes.""

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other ""like-minded"" countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries -- including the UK, Canada and most of Europe -- said in a joint statement that there is ""no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.""

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the ""Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.""

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to ""use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.""

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA's announcement, saying ""the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024's boxing qualifications and tournament.""

The statement said the IBA's suspension was ""still in force"" and that ""the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.""

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA's announcement of qualifying tournaments ""totally unacceptable"" and said it ""clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.""

""IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,"" he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained ""committed to the Olympic movement"" by following the IOC's principles of ""proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.""

On Wednesday, Ukraine's boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA's world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men's and women's championships.

""Our answer is clear -- our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,"" Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

Ilchenko added: ""As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country ... they will not participate.""",['Ben Morse'],2023-02-24
79,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/02/motorsport/fernando-alonso-formula-one-aston-martin-spt-intl,Fernando Alonso still hungry for success after joining 'ambitious' Aston Martin,"(CNN) More than 20 years after his Formula One debut, Fernando Alonso is as hungry as ever ahead of the start of the 2023 season, which gets underway on Friday at the Bahrain Grand Prix.

That desire for success led him to make the seismic decision last year to reject a new contract with Alpine to join Aston Martin, he tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies.

""It has to be an ambitious project. It has to be a project that wants to win, a project that will take anything and will do everything to make it happen. And that is what I feel in Aston Martin,"" the Spaniard said ahead of the season's start.

""There is this talent and this hunger for success, success and success.""

Success certainly comes naturally to the 41-year-old Spaniard. Having exploded onto the F1 scene in 2001, he won his first race in 2003 before winning back-to-back championships in 2005 and 2006, becoming the youngest double champion in the sport's history.

Since then, the winner of 32 races has had legendary battles with some of the best drivers of the last two decades, from Michael Schumacher and Kimi Räikkönen through to Lewis Hamilton and Sebastien Vettel, who Alonso has replaced at Aston Martin after the four-time champion retired from F1.

Aston Martin is Alonso's fifth team and the first move he has made since he returned to F1 with Alpine in 2021.

The frustration of the 2010s led to the Spaniard calling quits on his F1 career in 2018, retiring after five years without a race win and seemingly disillusioned with the sport.

He competed in the IndyCar Series, Le Mans' 24-hour race and the Dakar Rally, where he emerged unscathed from a crash in which his Toyota Hilux flew through the air after hitting a sand dune in Saudi Arabia.

Alonso won his first drivers' Championship in 2005 before retaining the title in 2006.

Three years later he made his sensational return to F1, but failed to hit the heights of his early career.

After finishing 10th in 2021 and ninth in 2022 with Alpine, Alonso turned down a one-year contract extension to join an Aston Martin team on its way up.

""The investment is there, the new facilities, new wind tunnel coming out. New people, joining the team from different experiences and different backgrounds,"" he says of Aston Martin's ""wonderful project.""

The investment is certainly there. Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin's boss and the father of Alonso's new partner, Lance, has put the money where his mouth is.

The team launched its new $200 million factory at Silverstone and broke the bank to bring in the best engineers and talent from other teams to support its new star driver.

With the new investment and Alonso's terrific performance at pre-season testing -- where he came second on the first day of testing in Bahrain -- Aston Martin looks set to become the best of the rest this season, behind usual title contenders Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes.

2023 season set for more controversies

The 2023 season is set to be the biggest yet, but it has got off to a rocky start after drivers complained about new rules introduced by governing body the FIA, restricting them from making ""political, religious and personal statements"" unless previously approved in writing.

The FIA has since responded by clarifying that drivers will be able to ""express their views on any political, religious or personal matter"" outside of races, but during races and on the track, any displays must be pre-approved by the governing body or the drivers will face sanctions.

The 2023 season is also set to be the busiest on record, with 23 races over nine months -- a decision that some drivers have opposed.

Current back-to-back champion Max Verstappen expressed his discontent with the calendar, previously telling CNN Sport: ""The problem is that we are traveling so much and it's getting more and more ... Basically, the question is, is it worth it to spend so much time away from family and friends by chasing more success?""

Alonso is hoping to compete with the top table of F1.

When asked if drivers have enough say in the future of the sport, Alonso thinks ""probably not.""

""But this is maybe not our role on this sport,"" he added. ""We drive these cars in on Sunday afternoons, but we cannot forget that this is a team sport.

""I think we have the right people leading the sport. We are in good hands with Liberty [Media], with Stefano Domenicali, with the FIA as well. I think we should put trust in our leaders.""

While Alonso admits that it will be ""challenging,"" he strikes a far more positive tone than many of his fellow drivers.

""I think it's going to be demanding on teams, mechanics, media, all of us,"" he said. ""But we love what we do. We have a dream job. We enjoy every second of it.""

Alonso unquestionably loves what he does. Last season, he overtook Kimi Räikkönen to become the first driver in F1 history to start 350 races, and doesn't look like stopping anytime soon.

He is coy on Aston Martin's chances of challenging this season, saying that a podium finish is not a ""realistic target at the moment,"" but if the pre-season omens are anything to go by, that target could rapidly become more reality than fantasy.

Two decades on from his first race win, Alonso looks like he might just be a contender once again.","['Amanda Davies', 'Alasdair Howorth']",2023-03-02

The team did not reveal the cause of death.

Richardson, who was a halfback at Wofford College, was the 154th player selected in the 1958 NFL Draft by the Baltimore Colts. However, he retired following his second season in the league over a money dispute and returned to Spartanburg, South Carolina where he started a career in business.

Richardson became the first former NFL player to own a team since George Halas when the league awarded Carolina a franchise in 1993. The Panthers inaugural season was in 1995.

In December 2017, Richardson announced that he would sell his principal stake after the team started investigating him for ""workplace misconduct.""

In 2018, David Tepper, founder of the hedge fund Appaloosa Management, agreed to purchase the team for a reported $2.2 billion, according to the Charlotte Observer.

Tiberi, an Italian who lives in San Marino, also risks losing his residency status after the conviction.

He admitted to testing out an air rifle he purchased last June by aiming at the head of the cat belonging to his neighbor, Amati, according to the court. The cat immediately died in the incident.

The 21-year-old Tiberi, who won a time trial bronze at the Junior European Road Championships in 2018 and a time trial gold at the Junior Road World Championships in 2019, apologized for the incident on Twitter.

At the rally, Mahomes, who was selected MVP for the NFL season and for the Super Bowl, lauded the Chiefs fans and said the future hold more big wins.

""This is just the beginning. We ain't done yet,"" Mahomes told the massive crowd in front of Union Station. ""So I'll make sure to hit y'all back next year, and I hope the crowd's the same.""

For the Chiefs' last Super Bowl win in 2020, it was estimated that between 800,000 and 1 million fans lined the streets to celebrate and early indications showed that number was likely to be matched.

Kansas City Chiefs fans wait for a rally to begin.

Despite the parade getting underway at midday local time, some fans had been waiting by the side of the road since 6 a.m. CT to ensure they were in prime position to see the parade go by.

85,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/22/football/palestianian-national-soccer-team-world-cup-spt-intl,"All eyes were on Morocco at the last World Cup. Now, Palestinian national team wants a slice of the action at 2026 tournament","(CNN) The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory's presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting ""free Palestine,"" while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel's creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel's capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel's creation -- in what Palestinians call the ""Nakba"" and Israelis call Independence Day -- clashes have been frequent.

Rami Hamadeh plays for the Palestianian national team against Jordan at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, AFC Asian Cup.

""Nakba"" means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

""The Israeli occupation doesn't just affect me, but affects ... Palestinian sports in general,"" the Palestinian team's goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

""Whether it's players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.""

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian football player Mahmoud Sarsak, who staged a hunger strike of nearly three months while in Israeli jail, is surrounded by relatives and supporters at the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on July 10, 2012 upon his release from prison.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel's ""illegal combatant"" policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said ""I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.""

But last year's AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

""The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It's the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,"" the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes' movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was ""clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.""

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

Makram Daboub (C) became the Palestinian national team's official coach in 2021.

The politics of travel

Nicknamed the ""Lions of Canaan"" and the ""Fedayeen,"" the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

""Our training base is in the West Bank, and I'm able to watch the matches here. But I can't watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can't come to the West Bank either,"" said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

""Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,"" Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, ""Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.""

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team's official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

""We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,"" said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer's world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won't be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

Morocco's Ismail El Haddad and Palestinian Yaser Hamed contest the ball in an Arab Cup game in December 2021.

""I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,"" said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

'Love of football'

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup -- the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages -- Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

""When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it's from the Palestinian bloodline,"" Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain's national football team if he's called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

""I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I'm proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It's like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,"" said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

The president of the Palestinian FA Jibril Rajoub holding a press conference with IOC President Thomas Bach (not seen) after their meeting in Ramallah, West Bank, on September 19, 2022.

The PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad's first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players' health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

""To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,"" said Shaheen.

""The nutritional support that's added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,"" Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been ""shining"" in the Portuguese league.

Oday Dabbagh, who plays club football in Portugal, is pictured playing for the Palestinian national team against Song Kum Song of North Korea during the 2018 AFC Under-23 Championship in Jiangyin city, east China's Jiangsu province, in January 2018.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA -- he plays for Portugal's F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team's future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn't always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel's control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association's (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn't violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its ""FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.""

Additionally, FIFA's football infrastructure projects ""include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,"" according to FIFA.

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, back right, and President of the Palestine Olympic Committee Jibril Rajoub, second right, back, meet with young Palestinian athletes at Faisal Al-Husseini stadium in the West Bank city of Al-Ram, north of Jerusalem, in September 2022.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces ""won't stop us from our plans.""

""This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,"" said Hilal.

""There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it's known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,"" Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn't hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

91,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/06/football/world-cup-final-penalty-shootout-spt-intl,World Cup final: How Argentina won penalty shootout,"(CNN) A soccer match lasts for 90 minutes, another 30 if there really needs to be a winner. But if it's still level after that, then the game will be decided with a penalty shootout , arguably the most nerve-shredding experience in all of sports.

For the fans, it's excruciating; at the World Cup in Qatar , one Argentina supporter sobbed uncontrollably as she watched the quarterfinal shootout against the Netherlands through her fingers. By the end, she looked distraught. All the emotion had been wrung out of her, and the tears that she cried were of relief, rather than joy.

For the players, such emotions are magnified tenfold. ""Love hurts,"" goes the anonymous quote, ""but not as much as penalties.""

Success or failure could be career-defining, one simple kick from 12 yards is weighed down by teammates' hopes and the expectation of potentially millions of fans. As the author Karl Wiggins put it, ""It's as if, for a few seconds, a player's soul is laid bare for the entire world to see.""

Very few people would admit to enjoying a shootout, but Professor Geir Jordet is an exception; he can't get enough of them.

""A penalty shootout is a very uncomfortable event,"" he told CNN Sport from his research facility in Oslo. ""It's painful because the pressure is so intense, and of course, the consequences of failing are so dire. Penalties, for me, are wonderful!""

Professor Jordet works at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, where he specializes in performance under extreme pressure. He's been studying shootouts for almost 20 years and has analyzed more than 200 of them, around 2,000 kicks in total.

He's studied the psychology of the event, observed the behavior and dynamics of the participants and crunched the data to conclude that even the most dramatic of shootouts can be swayed by teams who know what they're doing.

""The main factor in a penalty shootout is luck,"" the former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton once declared, but Jordet is convinced that it is never ""only a lottery.""

Aurelien Tchouameni misses France's third penalty in the World Cup final.

Penalties are more important than ever

The margin between success and failure in title matches seems to be getting slimmer, and so it's in shootouts, where the margins are even tighter, that soccer's biggest prizes are being decided.

""If you enter a major tournament today with the ambition to win,"" says Jordet, ""you're making a severe mistake if you're not prepared for penalties.""

In 2021, both the Brazilian men and the Canadian women needed penalty wins en route to Olympic gold in Tokyo; in the same month, Argentina survived a shootout to win the Copa América and Italy triumphed in the same way at the European Championship at Wembley.

Mohamed Salah had to endure laser pointers in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations final penalty shootout.

The following year was a bonanza for penalties.

Starting in February with Senegal's Africa Cup of Nations final win against Egypt. Liverpool won two English cup finals -- both against Chelsea -- on spot-kicks, while Real Betis and RB Leipzig won the Spanish and German Cup finals respectively from the spot.

Eintracht Frankfurt beat Rangers in the Europa League final on penalties while the Philadelphia Union missed all of its kicks to hand LAFC the title after an extraordinary MLS Cup Final.

The 2022 penalty party concluded in Qatar where there was a record five shootouts, including the final.

Within seconds of the final whistle being blown, Jordet can tell if one side has the edge. He's able to glean valuable information simply by observing the interactions on the field.

""The coach and the staff of some teams almost panic when the game goes to penalties,"" Jordet explained to CNN Sport. ""It seems like they don't know what to do. And then with other teams, it's all dealt with before the game and definitely before the penalties.""

Jurgen Klopp won plaudits for the way he managed two penalty shootout victories for Liverpool in the League and FA Cup finals.

Last season's FA Cup final was a case in point; Jordet observed that Liverpool's manager Jurgen Klopp had established a plan and communicated it calmly and warmly to each of his players within 90 seconds of the final whistle.

They spent the remaining time casually interacting and even laughing. Several more minutes had passed before Chelsea's seemingly fraught manager Thomas Tuchel approached his players, and he was still revising his notes.

""He moves to the middle of the circle, BEFORE he's done with the plan,"" Jordet observed in a tweet thread, ""Tuchel then asks his players about the shots, publicly in front of the whole team.

""There's plenty of group pressure when done this way, the chance of honest responses from the players drops, and it creates further stress that carries on to the shootout itself.""

Liverpool's efficient organization meant the players were able to take up a position within the center circle that was closest to their coaching staff, where Klopp continued to exude warmth and love.

Chelsea went on to miss two penalties and Liverpool claimed the trophy.

World Cup Final penalty masterclass

Nobody can influence the proceedings in a shootout more than the goalkeeper, who is involved in every single kick. Jordet's research has confirmed that the goalies aren't just there to stop the shots, they can be a positive influence on their teammates and a destructive force for their opponents.

In recent seasons, Argentina's 30-year-old goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez has established himself as a gamechanger in shootouts, the ""Machiavelli of football.""

Jordet has noticed that his psychological antics are a nightmare for his opponents. During the semifinal of the Copa América against Colombia in 2021, he intimidated his opponents with trash talk, saving three penalties in a 3-2 win.

Since the stadiums were empty of fans in that edition, Jordet has noted that you could clearly hear what he was saying, ""I can tell you're nervous. I know where you're going to shoot. Watch and see how I'm going to eat you up. Remember, I'm going to eat you up!""

But it was in the World Cup final against France that Martínez demonstrated the full range of his expertise.

Jordet says that he set the tone right from the start, arriving first in the penalty area and claiming the territory as his own. ""Martínez took a very proactive approach to everything,"" Jordet explained.

""He created his home in the penalty area. He initiated some handshakes with the first French players to arrive,"" a disarming strategy which makes opponents drop their guard and renders them more vulnerable when he later strikes.

Argentina fans played their part by pilling pressure on the French penalty takers.

For the first two French penalties, Martínez discreetly set about disrupting the takers, urging the referee to check the placement of the ball on the spot.

This kind of interference would be unsettling for any penalty takers, but he was also feeling out the referee: how much would he be prepared to tolerate?

Jordet believes that enabled Martínez to quickly assume a proactive role within just two kicks and was then able to ""fully get to work.""

Martínez saved the second penalty that he faced, diving low to his right to deny Kingsley Coman, and his celebration was exuberant.

Jordet notes that goalkeepers don't typically celebrate so wildly, but his research has shown that celebrations can influence subsequent events.

""We found, to our astonishment, that penalty takers who celebrate intensely have a statistically higher probability of ending up on the winning team.

""In fact, the next penalty taker for the opponent misses about 10-15% of the time, and your next [teammate] scores about 7 to 8% more of their penalties. These types of celebratory displays are contagious.""

By the time the third French player stepped up, Martínez knew that he could get away with almost anything. He snatched up the ball, turned his back on the referee and walked back to his goal line.

The approaching Aurélien Tchouaméni should have arrived at the biggest moment of his professional career to find the ball on the spot, instead Martínez was holding it, gesturing to the Argentine fans to increase the volume.

France fans show their support for les bleus during the World Cup final.

When the referee demanded its return, Martínez rolled it away at a 45-degree angle, forcing Tchouaméni to fetch it himself. Jordet has calculated that whenever a player has to wait for a kick, the probability of a goal drops by 20 to 30%.

Tchouaméni aimed low and to the left and missed.

By now, Martínez knew that his own teammates could face similar tactics from the French goalie Hugo Lloris, so he grabbed the ball himself and handed it to his incoming teammate Leandro Paredes, one of four Argentine penalty takers, who all scored.

Martínez was eventually booked for interfering with the fourth French player, Randal Kolo Muani, but by then the damage was done and Argentina won the shootout 4-2.

""Very calculated, creative, well executed,"" Jordet concludes, ""but of course also highly, highly cynical.""

Emiliano Martínez of Argentina attempted to distract Randal Kolo Muani ahead of his penalty.

Martínez showed very little remorse for his ""cynical"" actions. After the final he said, """"I have no words for it. I was calm during the penalty shootout and everything went as we wanted.""

""All that I have dreamed of has been achieved.""

Since the conclusion of the World Cup, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which determines the laws of football, confirmed to CNN Sport that it is looking to clarify what goalkeepers can and cannot do before penalties are taken.

This would include delaying the taking of the kick or touching the goalposts, crossbar or goal net.

Shootouts don't always have to be so negative, though; sometimes, they can be won with love.

Jordet notes that when LAFC's Cristian Tello missed the first penalty against Philadelphia in the MLS Cup Final, some of his teammates met him on his return to the center circle and walked him back in.

""You're implicitly saying to the others that even if you miss, you're a part of the group, which is the message that you would like to send to each other in a penalty shootout.""

Los Angeles made every other kick to claim the cup.

The power of intangibles

Some teams seem to revel in the cauldron of the shootout, while others dread it.

England has lost seven of the 10 that it's participated in, while the Netherlands have lost seven out of eight. Spain's loss to Morocco in 2022 means it's now lost a record four shootouts in the FIFA World Cup alone.

Jordet has seen enough to believe in ghosts; he says that if your team has lost in a previous shootout, even if you weren't involved in it, you're more likely to miss. Conversely, success begets success.

Having lost to Czechoslovakia and the famous Antonin Panenka penalty i n the European Championship final in 1976, Germany has won six in a row, Croatia has won its last four, and Argentina its last three, claiming both the Copa América and the World Cup.

More and more teams are coming to accept that understanding the psychology of shootouts is essential in the modern game, and 20 professional teams have already turned to Jordet's consultancy business for help.

""I totally think there's so much more to be discovered in the softer areas of sports science,"" Jordet says, dismissing the cynics who claim that skill development, relationships and psychology are important, but not quantifiable.

""I honestly would beg to differ. If you know what to look for, you can measure a lot of these things in games, and this is something I work on every single day. I think we will make some big progress in the years to come.""

The Moroccan team gathered together for a prayer before going on to beat Spain in their penalty shootout.

Jordet knows so much about penalties because he spent years trawling the archives, watching every single shootout from the World Cup, European Championship and Copa América since 1976. He's interviewed 25 players who were there and tested his predictions in practice with 15 elite teams.

""I love penalty shootouts,"" he says, ""I think it's the ultimate drama in football.""

And yet, much of the nuance he described in the World Cup final wouldn't have been obvious to the fans watching the game on TV because broadcasters tend to fill the space between the kicks with replays and closeups of anxious coaches and fans.

""The details that really mattered, the subplot of the event, can only be accessed if you're lucky enough to have access to isolated broadcast cameras or by scrolling through fan videos on YouTube.

""TV producers aren't always my friends,"" Jordet concludes, ""because they don't look at what I like to look at.""

But now that teams are beginning to realize the value of small details in shootouts, perhaps broadcasters might also consider innovating their approach. The greatest drama in sport is happening right under their noses, and sometimes they're missing the best bits.",['Don Riddell'],2023-03-06
92,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/07/sport/conor-benn-doping-analysis-reaction-spt-intl,Conor Benn has 'serious concerns' over boxing's drug testing after being cleared of failed test because of 'highly-elevated consumption of eggs',"(CNN) Conor Benn's scheduled fight with Chris Eubank Jr. last year was meant to be career defining for both men.

Except the fight never took place and now Benn says the fallout of its cancellation has raised serious questions about boxing's drugs testing protocols.

The two were scheduled to take to their ring almost exactly 30 years after their fathers had in two fights that gripped a generation of boxing fans. Benn and Eubank Jr. were fighting for more than just glory. This was a fight for family honor.

But on the eve of the bout, news of Benn failing a drugs test came to light. The bout was called off after Benn tested positive for clomiphene, a fertility drug used by women who struggle to ovulate.

Benn repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and in February 2023, the World Boxing Council (WBC) issued a statement clearing Benn of wrongdoing, stating that while his urine test indicated the presence of prohibited substances, his ""highly-elevated consumption of eggs"" prior to testing offered a ""reasonable explanation"" for his failed test.

Despite welcoming the news that he could return to the sport, the 26-year-old Benn has criticized the investigation and expressed his concerns about the transparency of the process, in particular leveling criticism at the WBC and the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC), the governing body for professional boxing in Great Britain.

In a statement posted on his Instagram story last week, Benn said that ""the manner in which I've been cleared has seemed to create further questions and add further fuel to baseless negative speculation.""

CNN has contacted the WBC and BBBofC for comment.

Cancellation

According to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), clomiphene in men can potentially boost testosterone levels ""by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis."" The drug is also included on the World Anti-Doping Agency's prohibited list under anti-estrogenic substances.

Benn began his statement on Instagram addressing the ruling saying that while he was ""grateful for the ultimate finding"" of being declared ""innocent of being a drugs cheat,"" he couldn't sit by without commenting on the whole investigation.

""It was the right decision and it was the only one I was willing to accept. The easy option would have been to accept a six month ban, save myself a huge legal bill and simply move on, by my reputation and my family name is worth more to me than that,"" he wrote.

""At no point did I indicate that I failed any VADA tests because of contaminated eggs,"" Benn wrote, referring to the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA), a third-party testing agency used by the fighters to ensure a clean bout and which carried out his test.

""As part of its lengthy investigation, the WBC instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet, and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause,"" he wrote, saying he provided a 270-page report to the body.

Benn added: ""However, I feel like the WBC statement did a disservice to my defence, which was based upon a comprehensive scientific review of the testing procedures which set out a number of reasons why we believed the results were completely unreliable and proved beyond any reasonable doubt that I am innocent.""

Benn is still under investigation from UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) and the BBCofC at the time of publication.

He criticized the BBCofC's handling of his case in his statement.

""As for the BBBoC, they attacked me publicly and privately during the most difficult time in my life, treating me with utter contempt and without any consideration for the fair process or my mental state.""

The BBCofC released their own statement on Twitter after the announcement from the WBC in February, saying that it was not ""party to the review"" and had not seen ""any evidence provided on Mr. Benn's behalf.""

It added that while ""it respects the WBC, the WBC is a sanctioning body and not a governing body. The BBCofC was the governing body with whom Mr. Benn was licensed at the material time, and as such any alleged anti-doping violation shall be dealt with in accordance with its rules and regulations.""

It pointed to the UK Anti-Doping Rules, brought in by UKAD, which the BBCofC adheres to and that as a result, ""the decision of the WBC does not affect the ongoing implantation of the BBCofC's rules (and those of UKAD).""

CNN has contacted the BBCofC for comment. UKAD declined to comment when given the opportunity.

Benn punches Chris Algieri during their WBA Continental welterweight title fight on December 11, 2021.

'Serious concerns'

The WBC's February ruling stated that they had found there to be ""no failures in the procedures"" in relation to Benn's sample and test.

But Benn said he thought there was a lack of transparency throughout the whole investigation, claiming that his sample tested negative three times, but ""without explanation"" was tested nine days later which resulted in the positive test.

According to Benn, he asked for his B sample from the drug test -- which the World Anti-Doping Agency says ""affords the athlete the opportunity to have second analysis performed in the event their A sample returns"" a positive test -- to be tested as soon as possible.

Benn also said in his statement that he has been advised to take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Benn said that he had never previously tested positive for a banned substance before October's test, adding to his belief that the result was a ""testing error.""

While Benn now says that he had to concentrate on ""rebuilding"" his career, the process he has gone through has given him ""serious concerns about the whole testing system"" in boxing.

""Anti-doping protections are obviously extremely important, but so is ensuring people are given due proves and presumed innocent until proven guilty. Cheaters should be caught and punished, but people like me who prove their innocent should be vindicated and allowed to continue their career.""

Benn admitted that he'd had suicidal thoughts as a result of the whole process, saying: ""I didn't think I'd see another day.""

""It's hurt me,"" Benn said in an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. ""I didn't think I was going to make it through this period. I didn't think I was going to make it through.""

When asked if he had felt suicidal, Benn replied: ""Yeah. Yeah, I'd say so -- and it upsets me now because I don't know how I got so bad. I got in a really bad way about it.

""I was shamed for something I hadn't even done. ... If I had done something wrong, I'm human. I'd raise my hands to it, 'I made a mistake,' whatever it is, I raise my hands. Never this.

""I felt seven years of hard work and sacrifice, and leaving my family and the image I maintain, was just ruined by somebody else's incompetence. It's been hard for the family.""

Background

At the time of Benn's positive test last year, the bout's promoter, Matchroom, and that organization's boss, Eddie Hearn, had been keen for the bout to go ahead despite it being ""prohibited"" by the BBBofC.

Hearn told the BBC at the time: ""As we stand right now, the BBBofC is not sanctioning the fight. That does not mean the fight is off, but there is a process we have to go through.

""Conor Benn is not suspended, he is free and clear to fight. There's lots going on with the lawyers.""

Eddie Hearn, boxing promoter of Matchroom boxing, speaks at the press conference ahead of Benn's scheduled fight with Eubank Jr.

Amid mounting public pressure and safety concerns, the fight was canceled.

The decision to overlook potential safety concerns and stage a bout including a fighter who had tested positive for a banned substance prompted criticism that boxing prioritizes the fight's money-making opportunities rather than the boxers' safety.

Weeks later, the BBBofC claimed that Benn voluntarily relinquished his license with the governing body just before allegations of misconduct against Benn were upheld.

Benn accused the BBBofC of conducting an ""unfair and biased procedure."" He also disputes that he relinquished his license.

""(Benn) strongly refutes the allegation of misconduct (which for the avoidance of doubt is not in relation to the Vada issue) and firmly believes that an independent tribunal will reach a wholly different conclusion,"" a statement said on Benn's Twitter at the time.

And a few months later, the WBC announced after it had conducted an investigation into the matter that Benn would be included in its ratings once again after it found that he had not ""engaged in intentional or knowing ingestion of clomiphene.""",['Ben Morse'],2023-03-07

While the island has long been famed for its top-level male boxers , women were blocked by an official prohibition on their practicing the sport competitively.

Cuba's government-run INDER sports institute claimed the sport was too violent for women, even as Cuban female athletes competed successfully in judo, karate and taekwondo.

For many hopeful women boxers on the island, the ban smacked of sexism -- and a missed opportunity.

""From the time we were in our mother's wombs we are fighters,"" long-time boxer and trainer Namibia Flores Rodríguez told CNN.

""We are always fighting for something, to raise our kids, to help our families, to be independent.""

Cuban women were previously limited to training in isolation and with no hope of competing in the sport.

Flores says she trained for years as many women interested in boxing do in Cuba: on her own dime and in gyms lacking in even the most basic equipment.

While they could learn and practice the sport as a hobby, the ban on women's boxing meant Cuban female athletes could not take part in tournaments on the island or abroad.

At least officially, women's boxing in Cuba did not exist.

A new dawn

In December, the first cracks in that glass ceiling appeared when officials made an about face after announcing that they had obtained the proper safety equipment for them -- such as padding and head gear.

""We took this step when we were sure, really convinced that it was the moment and we didn't have any concerns because our women would be protected,"" Cuban Boxing Commission President Alberto Puig de la Barca told reporters at a news conference.

The change, sports officials said at the news conference, was also the result of a newly implemented family code on the island that said women were required by law to have the same opportunities as men. That apparently included boxing.

Two weeks later, the first try outs were held at a cramped facility with a single boxing ring. Many of the women boxers had only recently switched from competing in martial arts or had merely dabbled in boxing.

Still, they sparred with passion, drawing appreciative cheering and applause from spectators.

After the first bout, an announcer exclaimed to the crowd of people watching, ""This is historic!""

Cuban boxer Namibia Flores has fought for years for women's boxing to be recognized in Cuba.

Boxer Legnis Cala Massó said she started boxing to learn self-defense and was still shocked to be putting on gloves to potentially represent her country.

""My first dream was to participate and that they would consider the women who were fighting in Cuba,"" she told CNN ahead of her bout. ""Now I want to be on the team.""

While Cuba's female boxers have a long way to go, officials are hopeful that their enthusiasm and natural ability can make up for lost time. Sports officials predicted that Cuban women boxers would compete in the Central American and Caribbean Games starting in June and the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.

The 39-year-old Flores has been a pioneer for Cuban women boxers.

Many female boxers said they had endured sexist jabs directed at them over the years, but novice fighter Melany de la Caridad Girado Bermudez told CNN she felt the perception of women taking part in the revered national sport was finally changing.

""In my case all the comments I have received have been positive. That if I make an effort, I can achieve it,"" she said. ""That Cuban women have the potential for this.""",['Patrick Oppmann'],2023-03-08

96,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/sport/damian-lillard-71-points-record-nba-spt-intl,Damian Lillard becomes first player in NBA history to score over 70 points in under 40 minutes,"(CNN) Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

""I enjoy those moments in the game when I'm just going after people,"" the NBA All-Star said after the game. ""That's all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.""

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell's 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting -- even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts -- just one off Klay Thompson's record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard's teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell's total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

""It really, really was a masterful performance,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star's game. ""It was a piece of art. That was incredible.""

Any postgame celebrations for Lillard were cut short after he was picked for a drug test.

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain's record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

""I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you're hot, you're in attack mode, you're feeling good,"" he said.

Not only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.

The Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.

The 32-year-old has no children of his own, but the four glistening trophies displayed in his home are equally cherished all the same.

The matching pairs of US Open and PGA Championships cups were all scooped in an unprecedented stretch between 2017 and 2019 that saw the American become the first golfer in history to win back-to-back titles in two different majors concurrently. Before Koepka, nobody had ever won their first four majors inside two years.

It means that, of the eight PGA Tour wins he has to his name, half are major triumphs. For Koepka, it's a ratio he is more than content with.

""Nothing quite feels the same, the majors are so different. It's the pinnacle of our sport, it's what you're judged by,"" Koepka told CNN.

""If you look at all the greats that have ever played this game, most people can't tell you how many PGA Tour events or how many European Tour events this person's won or that person's won, but they know exactly how many majors you've won.

""So, to me, that's what you're defined by.""

'I love it when athletes get cocky'

They are words that make for tough reading for the host of supremely talented golfers who never clinched, or are still chasing, a major win. With 11 runner-up finishes between them, Colin Montgomerie, Lee Westwood, and Rickie Fowler are just three acclaimed players for whom majors have proved elusive despite a plethora of professional wins.

Koepka has previously explained how majors are the easiest tournaments to win. It's a characteristic candidness that he makes no apologies for. In fact, he sees it as a strength.

""I'm pretty blunt, I don't like beating around the bush. I just say it how it is, I've always been that way,"" he said. ""I know my monotone can come off a little bit of a pain in the butt for people, but that's how I feel.

""I love it when athletes get cocky or confident in themselves -- I think that's important. Everybody needs that, no matter what profession, no matter what you're doing.

""If you feel you're the best then go ahead and say it and then just go back it up.""

Koepka poses with the Wanamaker Trophy after capturing his second PGA Championship title in 2019.

And Koepka has certainly backed it up. The Floridian has finished inside the top-five in 12 of his 34 career major starts, including three runner-up finishes.

Only five times has he missed the cut, and two of those came during an excruciating season last year.

Koepka's current Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) No. 85 status is the lowest position he has held since 2014 -- albeit with the caveat of his involvement in the LIV Golf Series which, due its exclusion from the OWGR weighting system, has adversely affected the ranking of players who have joined the Saudi-backed series.

Injury woes have compounded a painful fall from the summit for the former World No. 1. After tearing the patella tendon in his left knee in 2019, Koepka revealed this past October that he had ""dislocated and shattered"" his right knee in 2021. The injuries were so severe that the American wondered if his career was over.

His struggle to come to terms with his loss of form was laid bare in Netflix's new fly-on-the-wall golf documentary series ""Full Swing,"" where Koepka admitted his slump was ""the worst"" he had ever suffered in his life.

""There was a lot of stuff ... just in (my) personal life, had gone on. A lot of down times, man,"" Koepka told CNN.

""The injuries, you look back at it and a lot of time you're just sitting there. There's a lot of pain, a lot of stuff you've just got to endure, just to make it better. It's not always fun, not always glamorous.""

Koepka struggled for form during 2022.

Health is wealth

Yet Koepka still carries good memories of 2022, namely his marriage to Jena Sims and a cathartic win at the final individual event of the LIV Golf Invitational Series in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in October.

Alongside brother Chase, he also secured victory in the corresponding team event. Given Koepka had promised to buy his younger sibling a Lamborghini if they won, it put a dent in his $4 million individual winner's earnings, but ultimately ensured a happy ending to a disappointing campaign.

Brooks and Chase Koepka toast their victory at the LIV Golf Invitiational - Jeddah.

""To be able to finally have some happy times, some success with all the down stuff, it was very enjoyable ... something I can really, really look back on,"" Koepka said.

""I could feel the trend coming upwards, (during) the middle of the year -- I was getting out of the funk and just happy to be out of it now.

""Hopefully put all that stuff behind me and stay healthy for a while, that's the goal.""

Naturally though, that isn't Koepka's only goal for 2023. A self-confessed ""slow starter,"" he is looking to be up to speed by the time The Masters rolls around in April.

Runner-up to Tiger Woods in 2019, a green jacket would put Koepka on track for what he considers to be a ""good"" 2023.

""Hopefully a few wins, and then a major -- that's the goal every year,"" he said.",['Jack Bantock'],2023-03-07
98,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/03/sport/nfl-players-report-cards-teams-spt-intl,'Get rid of the rats': NFL players rate teams and reveal some 'gross' details,"(CNN) Given the multi-billion dollar nature of the business, you might think that no expense would be spared in ensuring NFL players' every need is taken care of. If so, think again.

In a survey published by the NFL Players' Association (NFLPA) on Wednesday, 1,300 players provided feedback on the league's 32 teams, which were then ranked in a variety of categories.

Look away now if you're a fan of the Los Angeles Chargers, the Arizona Cardinals or the Washington Commanders.

NFL players rated teams in the NFLPA's ""Club Report Cards"" survey based on their treatment of families, nutrition, weight room, strength and conditioning staff, training room, training staff and locker room. They also provided feedback specific to each team.

The Minnesota Vikings were ranked as the best overall: the NFLPA report pointing to the franchise's newly built, state-of-the-art facility, calling the team a ""shining example of what is possible when a concerted investment is made in both staffing and facilities.""

The Miami Dolphins came second, with the only critique being that players would ""like a better post-game family area with more accessibility for players' families."" The Las Vegas Raiders finished third.

At the other end of the scale, the Chargers, Cardinals and Commanders comprised the bottom three.

The Commanders finished last, with the franchise handed an F-minus for their training room, locker room and team travel, while also getting an F for treatment of families.

Complaints from players included an understaffed training room, undersized hot and cold tubs for player recovery, not enough personal space in the locker room and lack of warm water and issues with poor drainage in the showers.

The Chargers and Cardinals didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

In a statement sent to CNN, the Commanders said: ""Player health and safety is our top priority, and we continue to invest in our facilities, including a new practice field, new turf in the practice bubble and increased meeting room space. We know there is more to do, and we regularly talk with our players about ways to improve their work environment and the experience for their families.""

The Washington Commanders celebrate after Milo Eifler completes a play during the first half of the game against the Dallas Cowboys at FedExField on January 8, 2023.

Over one-fifth of players surveyed -- 22% -- also felt they didn't have enough space on team flights, with the Commanders one of seven teams in the NFL that apparently don't offer their players first-class seats.

The Cardinals ranked last in terms of food, with players complaining that they were charged for food at the facility, reportedly the only team to do so.

The team was also criticized heavily for the low standard of its facilities, with some complaining the weight room feels like a ""safety hazard.""

Players labeled the Chargers' hot and cold tubs ""gross.""

Meanwhile, the Jacksonville Jaguars appear to have a bit of a rodent problem.

""When asked what the number one thing they want changed at their facility, the answer was unanimous -- get rid of the rats! Players reported that for 3-4 weeks this season, there was a rat infestation in the locker room and laundry hampers,"" the report said.

The Jaguars didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

The Cincinnati Bengals are one of three teams that do not provide dinner to their players and are the only team that doesn't provide supplements. They are also the only team that does not have outlets in their lockers to charge devices.

The rankings aren't necessarily an indication of success on the field though, with the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs coming in at 29th.

The objective of the ""Club Report Cards"" was to help provide ""players with information about each club to not only help them make important career decisions, but also try and raise standards across each club,"" according to NFLPA president JC Tretter.

""One of our core jobs as a union is to improve the overall working conditions for our players,"" added Tretter.

""Often, you see our advocacy on 'big' issues -- like our push for better field surfaces at stadiums or standardized safety protocols that limit the risk of workplace injuries -- but it also includes the daily experience of players at the team facilities away from the lights and cameras,"" he said.",['Ben Morse'],2023-03-03

100,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/football/super-league-documentary-football-jeff-zimbalist-spt-intl,A 'political thriller' filled with personal betrayals. The inside story of the Super League and the war for soccer's soul,"(CNN) Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming -- just ask Julius Caesar, who asked ""Et tu Brute?"" as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition -- the Champions League -- are akin to a 'House of Cards' plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe's biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body's UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams -- the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary ""Super League: The War for Football,"" the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a ""political thriller ... 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,"" its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles -- or its future -- and, most stingingly of all, ""betrayal"" between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter's godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was ""sort of the general of the opposing army,"" Zimbalist says.

""The dynamics at play here aren't that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,"" he adds. ""The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.""

Aleksander Čeferin was elected UEFA President in 2016.

Characters -- normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews -- are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother's death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez's about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi's about his tennis playing days.

""This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,"" Zimbalist says. ""These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

""We were watching what's usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.""

'Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?'

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs -- all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to ""drop a legislative bomb"" to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

Andrea Agnelli was replaced by Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the chairman of the European Club Association.

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects' reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

""That was how we presented it to them,"" Zimbalist says.

""We're going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they're rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.""

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

""You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,"" he says. ""But then you're leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.""

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport's most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football's magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

Real Madrid won the 2022 Champions League.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

""This identity crisis in the sport -- is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?"" Zimbalist says. ""If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn't fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.""

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the ""cynical project,"" as seemingly, did football's world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA's more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

'The war for football rages on'

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with ""60 to 80 teams"" earlier this month.

Zimbalist's documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by ""old money"" clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by ""new money"" club such as PSG and Manchester City.

""We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,"" he says.

""And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?""

Giorgio Marchetti is the Deputy General Secretary of UEFA.

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team's representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors -- including Agnelli -- resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor's office in Turin.

Barcelona's already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become ""a reality in 2025.""

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN's Richard Quest last month that for them, ""the Super League is in the past.""

""It was something that we apologized for and ... going forward, it's not something that we're interested in.""

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league's fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the ""ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,"" Zimbalist says.

""Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.""",['Issy Ronald'],2023-02-27

But this time, it's due to investigations into the team's star player.

The Grizzlies lost their second straight game Tuesday without star guard Ja Morant , who had been under investigation by police after the 23-year-old posted an Instagram Live video of himself Saturday appearing to hold a gun at a nightclub outside of Denver.

While police have now decided against charges, the two-time All-Star point guard is the subject of an NBA investigation, a league spokesperson told CNN.

Morant has apologized for his actions via his representation on Saturday, after Memphis announced he would be away from the team

Morant said he would take time away ""to get help and work on learning better methods of dealing with stress and my overall well-being.""

Memphis head coach Taylor Jenkins said Sunday there is no timetable for Morant's return. The team tweeted Wednesday that Morant will miss at least four more games , meaning he will return no earlier than March 17.

Morant is averaging 27.1 points per game in his fourth NBA season.

The Instagram video, posted early Saturday morning and shared widely on social media, shows Morant briefly flashing what appears to be a gun while listening to music at a nightclub.

The police department in Glendale, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, said Wednesday the agency won't recommend charges against Morant.

""(The department) was not able to determine that probable cause existed for the filing of any charges. In this case, it should be noted that on the night in question (police) did not receive any calls for service at the nightclub regarding a weapon of any type,"" department officials said in a statement.

No one made a complaint and investigators concluded no one was threatened or menaced with a gun, police said.

It's unknown why Morant was carrying a gun or if it was his. The Grizzlies played in Houston against the Rockets on March 1 before heading to Denver for a game against the Nuggets on March 3.

If Morant did bring the gun onto team facilities -- which also includes the team plane -- he is subject to NBA discipline according to its Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).

The CBA states that players are prohibited from carrying firearms while ""physically present at a facility or venue owned, operated, or being used by a Team, the NBA, or any League-related entity, and whenever a player is traveling on any NBA-related business, whether on behalf of the player's Team, the NBA, or any League-related entity""

If a player is in violation of the ruling in the CBA, they could face a fine and/or a suspension.

""The Commissioner shall have the power to suspend for a definite or indefinite period, or to impose a fine not exceeding $50,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon any person who, in his opinion, shall have been guilty of conduct prejudicial or detrimental to the Association,"" the CBA reads.

While it is unclear what punishment Morant could face, the most recent example of a gun-related incident came in the 2009/10 season when Gilbert Arenas, a three-time All-Star, was suspended until the end of the season -- 50 games -- for bringing unloaded guns into his team's locker room, and making light of the incident once he was punished.

Arenas pleaded guilty but avoided jail time and was sentenced to two years of supervised probation, was embroiled in a dispute with teammate Javaris Crittenton -- who was also suspended the rest of the season for the incident -- over money in a poker game.

The US government said at the time that Arenas brought at least one firearm into the Washington Wizards' locker room.

Arenas would later return to the Wizards, while Crittenton was released by Washington after his suspension, playing two more years of professional basketball before being charged with murder in August 2011. In April 2015, Crittenton plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter with a weapon and aggravated assault with a firearm and was sentenced to 23 years in prison.

105,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/24/sport/boxing-olympics-chaos-iba-usa-spt-intl,Infighting in the sport and Russia's invasion of Ukraine leaves Olympic boxing on the ropes,"(CNN) It's an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible ""sabotage,"" saying the IBA had announced a ""false and misleading"" qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women's and men's world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA's running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the ""ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.""

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to ""come together and work together as a unit"" so it can ""continue to fight for our Olympic future.""

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be ""fundamental change"" before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body's decision was ""taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.""

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA's ""financial dependency"" on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the ""continuing and very concerning issues"" over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been ""dealing with significant governance issues,"" which it said were a ""burden from the past leadership.""

""We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC's upper echelon,"" the statement added.

""This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.""

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women's and men's world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be ""main qualification events"" for Paris 2024.

The IBA's announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation's banners -- or competing in general -- in many sports following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin's troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as ""neutral athletes.""

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other ""like-minded"" countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries -- including the UK, Canada and most of Europe -- said in a joint statement that there is ""no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.""

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the ""Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.""

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to ""use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.""

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA's announcement, saying ""the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024's boxing qualifications and tournament.""

The statement said the IBA's suspension was ""still in force"" and that ""the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.""

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA's announcement of qualifying tournaments ""totally unacceptable"" and said it ""clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.""

""IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,"" he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained ""committed to the Olympic movement"" by following the IOC's principles of ""proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.""

On Wednesday, Ukraine's boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA's world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men's and women's championships.

""Our answer is clear -- our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,"" Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

Ilchenko added: ""As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country ... they will not participate.""",['Ben Morse'],2023-02-24

Now, Palestinian national team wants a slice of the action at 2026 tournament","(CNN) The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory's presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting ""free Palestine,"" while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel's creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel's capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel's creation -- in what Palestinians call the ""Nakba"" and Israelis call Independence Day -- clashes have been frequent.

Rami Hamadeh plays for the Palestianian national team against Jordan at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, AFC Asian Cup.

""Nakba"" means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

""The Israeli occupation doesn't just affect me, but affects ... Palestinian sports in general,"" the Palestinian team's goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

""Whether it's players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.""

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian football player Mahmoud Sarsak, who staged a hunger strike of nearly three months while in Israeli jail, is surrounded by relatives and supporters at the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on July 10, 2012 upon his release from prison.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel's ""illegal combatant"" policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said ""I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.""

But last year's AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

""The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It's the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,"" the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes' movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was ""clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.""

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

Makram Daboub (C) became the Palestinian national team's official coach in 2021.

The politics of travel

Nicknamed the ""Lions of Canaan"" and the ""Fedayeen,"" the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

""Our training base is in the West Bank, and I'm able to watch the matches here. But I can't watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can't come to the West Bank either,"" said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

""Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,"" Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, ""Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.""

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team's official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

""We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,"" said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer's world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won't be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

Morocco's Ismail El Haddad and Palestinian Yaser Hamed contest the ball in an Arab Cup game in December 2021.

""I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,"" said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

'Love of football'

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup -- the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages -- Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

""When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it's from the Palestinian bloodline,"" Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain's national football team if he's called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

""I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I'm proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It's like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,"" said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

The PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad's first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players' health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

""To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,"" said Shaheen.

""The nutritional support that's added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,"" Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been ""shining"" in the Portuguese league.

Oday Dabbagh, who plays club football in Portugal, is pictured playing for the Palestinian national team against Song Kum Song of North Korea during the 2018 AFC Under-23 Championship in Jiangyin city, east China's Jiangsu province, in January 2018.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA -- he plays for Portugal's F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team's future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn't always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel's control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association's (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn't violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its ""FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.""

Additionally, FIFA's football infrastructure projects ""include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,"" according to FIFA.

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, back right, and President of the Palestine Olympic Committee Jibril Rajoub, second right, back, meet with young Palestinian athletes at Faisal Al-Husseini stadium in the West Bank city of Al-Ram, north of Jerusalem, in September 2022.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces ""won't stop us from our plans.""

""This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,"" said Hilal.

""There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it's known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,"" Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn't hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.

While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.

""There's a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,"" said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

""For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,""

Coach Daboub goes even further.

Following years of lawsuits and lobbying from players, the Federation last year agreed to a new 50-50 split in the way it pays men and women competing for the US national soccer teams, meaning both sides will receive the same pay and prize money, including for participating at World Cups.

""There was a relentlessness, and a refusal to accept anything other than what we felt like we deserved,"" Rapinoe told WBD sports analyst Julie Foudy, adding she's proud of ""the group effort that it took.""

""It was almost like we couldn't lose, I said that a lot. If the Federation won, everybody loses and if we win, everybody wins,"" the two-time World Cup champion added.

Rapinoe said the team worked together and saw setbacks, not as losses, but as ""just a step on the journey. Ultimately, I think that gave us a lot of confidence on the field as well -- we were all in it together, we were all doing our part.""

The USWNT fought for the agreement for years, through lawsuits and lobbying.

Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday, that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind.

A nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American's fifth PGA Tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.

""I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety,"" Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort.

""I wouldn't be doing this for a living anymore. I probably wouldn't have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.

""For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.

""It's something that's constantly on my mind, so it's pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.""

Kirk during the final round.

'I got sober because of you'

On the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019, Kirk announced he would be taking an ""indefinite leave"" from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.

""I thought I could control it, but after multiple relapses, I have come to realize I can't fix this on my own,"" Kirk added in a social media post.

By that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.

A tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk's sole top-40 finish of the campaign.

When he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further -- he was world No. 303 -- but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.

candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer's previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.

Kirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to ""accelerate"" his alcohol issues.

For Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.

Kirk is congratulated by his caddie after victory.

""It's been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, 'I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],"" Kirk said.

""When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more ... for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.

""So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.

""But now on the back end a little bit, it's been amazing. Like I said, it's not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and ... for somebody to say, 'I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,' you can't really describe how unreal that is with words.""

Augusta calling

On Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.

The American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot -- ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event -- who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.

For both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.

Again, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.

When Cole's birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip's hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.

As well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday's triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.

""I've been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that's going to be something that's incredibly special,"" Kirk said.

""That par-3 contest can't come soon enough. I'm really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.""

On Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.

""It'll be a lot of celebrating, and I thank God that alcohol won't be a part of it,"" Kirk said.",['Jack Bantock'],2023-02-27

Djokovic, who is unvaccinated against Covid-19 , said last month that he had hoped for a ""positive result"" on being able to receive special permission to play tournaments in the US, where international visitors must be vaccinated in order to gain entry.

Georgian player Nikoloz Basilashvili has taken Djokovic's place in the draw.

Speaking to reporters on Friday after his defeat against Daniil Medvedev in Dubai, the Australian Open champion said he was ""still waiting for the news from America.""

He added: ""If there's no America, I guess I'll play clay. Monte Carlo is probably the next tournament. If that's the case, I'll take some time off, I'll prepare.""

CNN has contacted Djokovic's representatives for comment on his withdrawal from Indian Wells but did not receive a response.

The tournament begins on Monday and concludes on March 19.

Last week, the US Open said in a tweet that Djokovic is one of the ""greatest champions our sport has ever seen,"" adding that organizers of the grand slam were ""hopeful"" his petition to enter the country would be successful.

Djokovic began the year by defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas to win the Australian Open, equaling Rafael Nadal's record of 22 grand slam singles titles in the men's all-time list.

117,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/02/motorsport/fernando-alonso-formula-one-aston-martin-spt-intl,Fernando Alonso still hungry for success after joining 'ambitious' Aston Martin,"(CNN) More than 20 years after his Formula One debut, Fernando Alonso is as hungry as ever ahead of the start of the 2023 season, which gets underway on Friday at the Bahrain Grand Prix.

That desire for success led him to make the seismic decision last year to reject a new contract with Alpine to join Aston Martin, he tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies.

""It has to be an ambitious project. It has to be a project that wants to win, a project that will take anything and will do everything to make it happen. And that is what I feel in Aston Martin,"" the Spaniard said ahead of the season's start.

""There is this talent and this hunger for success, success and success.""

Success certainly comes naturally to the 41-year-old Spaniard. Having exploded onto the F1 scene in 2001, he won his first race in 2003 before winning back-to-back championships in 2005 and 2006, becoming the youngest double champion in the sport's history.

Since then, the winner of 32 races has had legendary battles with some of the best drivers of the last two decades, from Michael Schumacher and Kimi Räikkönen through to Lewis Hamilton and Sebastien Vettel, who Alonso has replaced at Aston Martin after the four-time champion retired from F1.

Aston Martin is Alonso's fifth team and the first move he has made since he returned to F1 with Alpine in 2021.

The frustration of the 2010s led to the Spaniard calling quits on his F1 career in 2018, retiring after five years without a race win and seemingly disillusioned with the sport.

He competed in the IndyCar Series, Le Mans' 24-hour race and the Dakar Rally, where he emerged unscathed from a crash in which his Toyota Hilux flew through the air after hitting a sand dune in Saudi Arabia.

Alonso won his first drivers' Championship in 2005 before retaining the title in 2006.

Three years later he made his sensational return to F1, but failed to hit the heights of his early career.

After finishing 10th in 2021 and ninth in 2022 with Alpine, Alonso turned down a one-year contract extension to join an Aston Martin team on its way up.

""The investment is there, the new facilities, new wind tunnel coming out. New people, joining the team from different experiences and different backgrounds,"" he says of Aston Martin's ""wonderful project.""

The investment is certainly there. Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin's boss and the father of Alonso's new partner, Lance, has put the money where his mouth is.

The team launched its new $200 million factory at Silverstone and broke the bank to bring in the best engineers and talent from other teams to support its new star driver.

With the new investment and Alonso's terrific performance at pre-season testing -- where he came second on the first day of testing in Bahrain -- Aston Martin looks set to become the best of the rest this season, behind usual title contenders Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes.

2023 season set for more controversies

The 2023 season is set to be the biggest yet, but it has got off to a rocky start after drivers complained about new rules introduced by governing body the FIA, restricting them from making ""political, religious and personal statements"" unless previously approved in writing.

The FIA has since responded by clarifying that drivers will be able to ""express their views on any political, religious or personal matter"" outside of races, but during races and on the track, any displays must be pre-approved by the governing body or the drivers will face sanctions.

The 2023 season is also set to be the busiest on record, with 23 races over nine months -- a decision that some drivers have opposed.

Current back-to-back champion Max Verstappen expressed his discontent with the calendar, previously telling CNN Sport: ""The problem is that we are traveling so much and it's getting more and more ... Basically, the question is, is it worth it to spend so much time away from family and friends by chasing more success?""

Alonso is hoping to compete with the top table of F1.

When asked if drivers have enough say in the future of the sport, Alonso thinks ""probably not.""

""But this is maybe not our role on this sport,"" he added. ""We drive these cars in on Sunday afternoons, but we cannot forget that this is a team sport.

""I think we have the right people leading the sport. We are in good hands with Liberty [Media], with Stefano Domenicali, with the FIA as well. I think we should put trust in our leaders.""

While Alonso admits that it will be ""challenging,"" he strikes a far more positive tone than many of his fellow drivers.

""I think it's going to be demanding on teams, mechanics, media, all of us,"" he said. ""But we love what we do. We have a dream job. We enjoy every second of it.""

Alonso unquestionably loves what he does. Last season, he overtook Kimi Räikkönen to become the first driver in F1 history to start 350 races, and doesn't look like stopping anytime soon.

He is coy on Aston Martin's chances of challenging this season, saying that a podium finish is not a ""realistic target at the moment,"" but if the pre-season omens are anything to go by, that target could rapidly become more reality than fantasy.

Two decades on from his first race win, Alonso looks like he might just be a contender once again.","['Amanda Davies', 'Alasdair Howorth']",2023-03-02

If the PGA Tour's revamped 2024 schedule succeeds in pitting the golf's major stars against one another more regularly, the sport's latest rivalries could be about to get more showings.

The new schedule offers increased prize purses, smaller fields, and no cuts, much like the breakaway LIV Golf Series

""It is more opportunity for the top players to battle it out late on Sundays,"" world No. 8 Max Homa told reporters.

""Which, you look back at times of Phil and Tiger, the two best players growing up for me watching, and they had like maybe two real battles. So we're going to have more of that.""

World No. 3 Rory McIlroy is another supporter of the revamp, describing as it as ""trying to get the top guys vs. the hot guys.""

Unveiled by PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan in a letter to the Tour's membership, the new schedule will include eight ""designated events"" made up of between 70 and 78 players.

Eligibility criteria, as well as which events are to be marked as ""designated,"" are set to be specified at a later date, a press release from the Tour said.

However, it added that the ""framework"" for eligibility will ""reward top performers"" on the Tour -- including the top 50 players from the previous year's FedEx Cup rankings, the top-30 PGA Tour players in the world rankings, and tournament winners during the season.

And with no 36-hole cut line, all golfers competing will play the entirety of the events that offer elevated purses, as well as FedEx Cup points.

Though involvement will not be mandatory, these two factors, as well as the competitiveness and ""prestige"" of the tournaments, will ""incentivize"" participation, the Tour added.

""These smaller, Designated event fields will not only deliver substantial, can't-miss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season, but they will also enhance the quality of Full-Field events,"" Monahan said in the letter to players.

""Together, this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive, compelling, consequential and with clarity for fans, players and sponsors alike.""

The new scheduling will not affect the majors, The Players Championship, as well as three FedEx Cup Playoff events. Their existing format is set to remain unchanged, with designated events run in addition.

'Imitation is the greatest form of flattery'

Designated events were first announced by the PGA Tour last August, with 12 on the 2023 schedule. The first on this season's calendar was the Phoenix Open in February, as Scottie Scheffler secured $3.6 million in prize money.

Though still including a cut line, the increased purses at these tournaments were offered as a response to the emergence of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Series last year.

Bankrolled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), LIV Golf offered huge amounts of money for players to leave the established tours -- the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour -- to join the new series.

PIF pledged to award $250 million in total prize money for the tour's inaugural season. Of the $25 million prizes purses offered at each of the first seven events, $20 million was a guaranteed split between players. Played across three rounds as opposed to the typical four, golfers could not be cut as part of a team-based format.

""Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Congratulations PGA Tour. Welcome to the future,"" read a tweet from LIV Golf's official account Wednesday.

The inaugural LIV Golf event was hosted at Centurion Club in St Albans, England in June 2022.

Ahead of the PGA Tour's Arnold Palmer Invitational this week, a host of its big-name golfers were quizzed on their views about the revamped schedule.

Consistently outspoken against LIV Golf, accusing it of ""ripping apart"" men's professional golf, McIlroy has previously been dubbed the de-facto spokesperson for the PGA Tour.

Asked whether the new schedule's restricted eligibility criteria could leave lower-ranked golfers ""on the outside looking in,"" the four-time major champion said he was firmly behind the new plans.

""I love it,"" McIlroy told reporters Wednesday. ""Obviously I've been a part of it and been in a ton of discussions. I think it makes the TOUR more competitive.

""I'm all about rewarding good play. I want to give everyone a fair shake at this. Which I think this structure has done. There's ways to play into it.

When Scheffler was asked whether designated events were threatening to create a ""closed shop,"" the world No. 2 said: ""I think it's exciting because you're going to have the top guys in the world playing against each other more often.

""You're going to be able to guarantee the sponsors that those guys are going to be there four days. I think that's a lot of value added to TV and for sponsors.

""I think it's a better model overall for the Tour to have a set of events that are aspirational and that give guys access to those events.

""If you earn your way in to those events, the top 50 in the FedExCup this year gets into all of 'em ... I think it's more of a reward for the guys that are playing the best on the Tour.""

McIlroy discussed his thoughts on the new schedule on Wednesday.

Scheffler: Money not a factor

Discussing the increased spotlight on prize purses, Scheffler insisted that money was not a ""motivating factor"" for players on the PGA Tour.

""We get paid a ridiculous amount of money to do what we do out here, but I don't think money is the motivating factor for too many guys,"" Scheffler said.

""You can't really base life decisions when it comes to money. When you're out here playing golf tournaments you're never thinking about the money, you just want to win the tournament.

""So as being kind of a golf purist, that's the motivation. I want to be able to play well, win tournaments and get the most out of my game.""

In response to the absence of a cut line at designated events, McIlroy highlighted the absence of cuts at various existing PGA Tour events -- including the CJ Cup and the Zozo Championship -- as proof there is a ""precedent"" for the format.

""The only reason no-cut events are a big deal is because LIV has come along ... There's been no-cut events since I've been a member of the TOUR and way beyond that as well,"" McIlroy said.

""It keeps the stars there for four days. You ask Mastercard or whoever it is to pay 20 million dollars for a golf event, they want to see the stars at the weekend. They want a guarantee that the stars are there. So if that's what needs to happen, then that's what happens.""

Homa's 'rant'

Perhaps the most impassioned defense of the new scheduling however, came from Homa, who warned he could ""rant on this for awhile"" regarding the changes as the 32-year-old American delivered a four four-minute monologue.

While he understood ""gripes"" around the limited fields, Homa said that discussions with Monahan had confirmed his belief that the plans were positive for the game.

""I think it's easy to frame these changes as a way to put more money in the top players' pockets, but it has been made to make it easier and more fun for the fans,"" said Homa.

Addressing concerns over restricted fields, Homa highlighted the example of an unnamed golfer who had become a ""running joke"" due to his participation in a PGA Tour event. According to Homa, the player was a professional golfer but was no longer a practicing pro.

""Those people will be in a ton of the events,"" he said.

Homa in action during the pro-am prior to the Arnold Palmer Invitational.

""Now the sponsors have to say, 'Well do we want ... a chunk of the field [being] guys that won an event years and years ago that have jobs or have retired well before that,"" added Homa.

""It is a major in a way or a major field every single week.

""So I think it will be a new and improved challenge. I think it's important that we all test each other against one another each week. If you don't, you will get pushed aside and have to work your way back up.

""It will be a different kind of stress that we haven't had before, but I do think it will be stressful.""

Asked if he wanted a break before continuing with the rest of his press conference, Homa declined, quipping: ""Sorry guys. I think a lot and you just heard my brain spill out.""",['Jack Bantock'],2023-03-02

123,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/football/super-league-documentary-football-jeff-zimbalist-spt-intl,A 'political thriller' filled with personal betrayals. The inside story of the Super League and the war for soccer's soul,"(CNN) Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming -- just ask Julius Caesar, who asked ""Et tu Brute?"" as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition -- the Champions League -- are akin to a 'House of Cards' plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe's biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body's UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams -- the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary ""Super League: The War for Football,"" the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a ""political thriller ... 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,"" its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles -- or its future -- and, most stingingly of all, ""betrayal"" between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter's godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was ""sort of the general of the opposing army,"" Zimbalist says.

""The dynamics at play here aren't that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,"" he adds. ""The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.""

Aleksander Čeferin was elected UEFA President in 2016.

Characters -- normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews -- are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother's death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez's about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi's about his tennis playing days.

""This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,"" Zimbalist says. ""These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

""We were watching what's usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.""

'Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?'

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs -- all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to ""drop a legislative bomb"" to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

Andrea Agnelli was replaced by Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the chairman of the European Club Association.

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects' reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

""That was how we presented it to them,"" Zimbalist says.

""We're going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they're rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.""

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

""You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,"" he says. ""But then you're leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.""

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport's most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football's magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

Real Madrid won the 2022 Champions League.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

""This identity crisis in the sport -- is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?"" Zimbalist says. ""If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn't fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.""

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the ""cynical project,"" as seemingly, did football's world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA's more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

'The war for football rages on'

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with ""60 to 80 teams"" earlier this month.

Zimbalist's documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by ""old money"" clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by ""new money"" club such as PSG and Manchester City.

""We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,"" he says.

""And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?""

Giorgio Marchetti is the Deputy General Secretary of UEFA.

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team's representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors -- including Agnelli -- resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor's office in Turin.

Barcelona's already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become ""a reality in 2025.""

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN's Richard Quest last month that for them, ""the Super League is in the past.""

""It was something that we apologized for and ... going forward, it's not something that we're interested in.""

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league's fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the ""ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,"" Zimbalist says.

""Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.""",['Issy Ronald'],2023-02-27

Thursday -- 31 years, 15 major triumphs and 82 PGA Tour wins later -- a very different Woods, one pained by injury, played at the same venue for the Genesis Invitational , a tournament he hosts where proceeds go to his TGR Foundation.

Yet, in terms of his mentality, it will be the same Woods at the tee.

""If I'm playing in the event, I'm going to try and beat you,"" Woods told reporters Tuesday.

""So I don't understand that making the cut's a great thing. If I entered the event, it's always to get a W. There will come a point in time when my body will not allow me to do that anymore, and it's probably sooner rather than later, but wrapping my ahead around that transition and being the ambassador role and just trying to be out here with the guys, no, that's not in my DNA.""

Woods started the tournament Thursday with a 2-under par 69, with birdies on his final three holes. He was five shots back of tournament leaders Max Homa and Keith Mitchell.

After suffering serious leg injuries in a car accident in February 2021, the story of the 47-year-old's recent career has been of one decimated by injury and a grueling recovery process.

Woods' participation in California this week marks his first official tournament start since The Open Championship in July last year and only his first non-major PGA Tour event since the ZOZO Championship in October 2020.

There were a couple of cameos in December -- a father-son outing at the PNC Championship and a friendly battle at TNT's The Match -- but even in those, he looked to be visibly struggling with movement at various points.

His position on playing a limited schedule, picking and choosing a select number of tournaments, remains the same, with Woods earmarking The Masters at Augusta as a potential target. While he revealed his leg has improved, Woods admitted struggles with his ankle mean prolonged spells of walking remain challenging.

""I can still hit shots, but it's the walking endurance that's hard,"" he said.

""That's something that we've had to work on, walking distances on the beach, just basically stress it out but also be able to recover by the next day and see how it is inflammation-wise and then keep practicing.

""I may have overdone it a couple times here or there, but here I am.""

Record in sight

Woods arrives in California on the precipice of greatness. His victory at the 2019 ZOZO Championship tied legendary compatriot Sam Snead for the all-time record of 82 PGA Tour wins, meaning that one more triumph would see Woods become the outright leader.

Snead's feat was a benchmark that once seemed insurmountable until a prodigious talent emerged at the turn of the century. Sound familiar? Earlier this month, LeBron James sunk his 38,388th career point to surpass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA's all-time leading scorer.

""What he [James] accomplished is absolutely incredible -- just the durability, the consistency and the longevity,"" Woods said.

""I grew up watching Kareem here ... that record we never thought it would be surpassed. What LeBron is doing -- but also the amount of minutes he's playing -- no one's ever done that at that age, to be able to play all five positions, that's never been done before at this level for this long.

""As far as our equivalent to that, I don't know, maybe you look at maybe me and Sam [Snead] at 82? It takes a career to get to those numbers. That's how I think probably best how you look at it.""

Woods is one win away from surpassing Snead's record.

Woods Thursday was part of a star-studded grouping, playing alongside four-time major winner Rory McIlroy and two-time major champion Justin Thomas. A smiling Woods finished with five birdies and three bogeys in his round, while McIlroy shot a 4-under 67 and Thomas carded a 68.

McIlroy is vying to instantly reclaim the world No. 1 spot he lost to Scottie Scheffler on Sunday when the American defended his crown at the Phoenix Open . The victory clinched a fifth PGA Tour title for Scheffler, who is excited to go again with the added bonus of Woods on the fairways.

""Tiger means so much to us as players out here on Tour and he's done so much for us out here that it's fun for us to be able to see him still continue to do what he loves,"" he told reporters Tuesday.

""It was pretty scary a few years ago when he got in that accident and we didn't know if he was going to be able to do this again, and so just to have him out here on the grounds and to see him around doing what he loves to do is a lot of fun for us.""

A new look PGA Tour

A $3.6 million winner's reward will be up for grabs, though defending champion Joaquin Niemann will not be in California to defend his title. The Genesis Invitational is one of the PGA Tour's ""designated events,"" offering a boosted prize purse of $20 million to rival the offerings of the LIV Golf Tour, of which Niemann is a part of.

On Tuesday, Woods said that while there were ""mixed emotions"" among players on the Tour's new format, he was optimistic about its development.

""From a marketing side of it and from the Tour side of it and the future of our sport, it's been very positive,"" Woods said.

""We need to keep going with it and need to stay aligned and keep progressing and making it better. We need to produce the best product we possibly can to sell to all the viewerships.

""It's about us creating the best products so we have more eyes on it, more stars, people want to come out and either watch the game of golf, participate, either on social media or the different streaming platforms,"" he added.

Speaking Wednesday, McIlroy said the feedback he had received about the designated events echoed what Woods had heard.

""It's the top half of the membership being really happy that they're in them and... but then the guys maybe on the outside looking in being worried about if they're always going to be on the outside looking in,"" McIroy told reporters.

""I think that the big thing has been, 'Is this going to be like a closed shop for the same guys every single week?' And it's not. This tour was built on meritocracy. This tour was built on if you shoot the scores, you can move up the levels and play the biggest events. That's not going to be taken away.

""It's just about making it more competitive. Ultimately, I think that's a good thing. Like I'm not saying that we're going to have field sizes of 50, it's going to be closer to what you've seen in the past. We're not trying to limit opportunities out here, but we also want to make sure that when people get opportunities, it's the most competitive, most competitive tournaments and the most competitive product that we can put out there.""",['Jack Bantock'],2023-02-16

It was Woods' shot on the 13th hole at the Riviera Country Club that veered off to the right and somehow found its way into a fan's jacket.

""All of a sudden he hit, and nobody knows where it went,"" the fan later told the PGA Tour. ""I looked and I had this bump in my pocket, you know my jacket which I had wrapped around ... and I pulled it off and a ball dropped off and it was his.""

After receiving a free ball drop, Woods went on to save par. He had earlier hit an eagle on his 1st hole, his first since the 2020 Genesis Invitational.

He ended the round with an impressive four-under 67, shooting three birdies and an eagle for his best round of the week and the third-lowest score of the day.

Two judges both scored the fight 76-73 for Fury, with the third judge ruling 75-74 in favor of Paul at the end of their eight-round cruiserweight bout at the Diriyah Arena near the capital Riyadh

British reality TV star Tommy Fury (C) celebrates after his split decision win against US YouTuber Jake Paul.

Paul, a 26-year-old American with more than 20 million YouTube subscribers, is now 6-1 while Fury, the British younger half-brother of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury , remains undefeated with nine wins after taking time out of his boxing career in 2019 to star in reality show ""Love Island.""

Millions of fans were expected to tune into the fight, the latest pay-per-view bout involving a YouTuber to generate a social media buzz as promoters played up the bad blood between the two fighters. And just like a genuine world title fight, there were plenty of stars ringside, including former champ Mike Tyson, soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and comedian Kevin Hart.

Fury asserted his jab early to keep Paul at a distance but the YouTuber gained momentum in the fifth round, appearing to stun Fury.

Both had points deducted -- Paul in the fifth for pushing his opponent's head down while clinching and Fury in the sixth for too much clinching, a defensive tactic that's often only allowed for short periods of time.

Fury was knocked down in the eighth round on a short-left hand by Paul but it was too late as the judges ruled in Fury's favor.

Paul said he intended to use a rematch clause for Sunday's fight that could be exercised if Fury won.

""All respect to Tommy, he won, don't judge me by my wins, judge me by my losses. I'll come back, I thought I deserve that rematch, it was a great fight, a close fight,"" Paul said after the fight.

132,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/16/sport/lesley-paterson-all-quiet-on-the-western-front-film-triathlon-spt-intl,How a world champion triathlete earned an Oscar nomination,"(CNN) It's while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.

A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.

She counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.

The film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer -- a young army recruit and the story's protagonist -- notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.

Unbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.

""It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film -- that the uniform's more important than the man,"" Paterson tells CNN Sport

""It's just one of those moments where you know it's good and you think: 'Oh my God ... where did this come from?' You feel so lucky that you've thought of it.""

The scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment

""If we can hold up a mirror to what's going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller -- to effect change,"" says Paterson.

Felix Kammerer stars as Paul Bäumer in ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""

First portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, ""All Quiet"" focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.

Paterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.

The end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world's first mechanized war in chilling detail.

It has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations -- including for best adapted screenplay -- and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations

The BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 -- two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.

A five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.

That was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.

With the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.

""I do a lot of one-arm drills,"" says Paterson. ""I was always really good at it and I've got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: 'Well, I can do one arm, let's give this a shot.'""

After finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.

""I just kind of kept on going,"" she says. ""And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.""

Triathlete Lesley Paterson competes for Great Britain in Birmingham, Alabama, in 2012.

The experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.

""I don't know if that's the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it's just truly I'm driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,"" she says. ""I'm a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.""

Paterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series -- ""all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,"" she says -- having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.

After she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in -- and winning -- races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get ""All Quiet"" off the ground.

""Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it's a lot of money,"" says Paterson.

""Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn't necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.""

Over the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she's doing and an obsessive attention to detail.

""I've always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,"" says Paterson.

""People think they are often very separate, but they're actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I'd say that I truly am the athlete I am because I'm an artist and the artist I am because I'm an athlete.""

""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed.

Whether it's sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of ""looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.""

It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 -- the only girl in a team of boys -- and why she chose to tackle ""All Quiet"" at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.

The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes' ""1917"" four years ago.

And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching ""All Quiet"" in German, rather than English.

""There's an authenticity -- it's their story, it's their national novel, it's rightly so that it's in German,"" says Paterson.

The popularity of ""All Quiet"" may take Paterson's life in a different direction, especially now that she's 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.

Whatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.

""It's focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes -- that was a huge learning curve for me,"" she says.

""As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you're at ... That's where the beauty comes.""",['George Ramsay'],2023-02-16

Casemiro broke the deadlock minutes after the half-hour mark, heading home from a Luke Shaw freekick.

Five minutes later, the lead was doubled after Marcus Rashford looked to have continued his electric form when his deflected strike just evaded Lorius Karius to fly into the Newcastle goal despite the German's despairing fingertips -- it was later ruled to be a Sven Botman own goal.

The trophy cements an excellent turnaround under Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag who has transformed the club from perennial underachievers to trophy winners in just over 10 months.

""It's an amazing feeling, we've been searching for this moment, us, the fans, the club, finally we get our trophy, we deserve it,"" Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes told Sky Sports just moments after the final whistle.

""It's been an amazing period. The first trophy of the season but we want more. It's not enough for this club, we want more and we need more because our standards deserve more.""

Turnaround

It was a final longtime coming for both teams for different reasons.

For Manchester United, the club hasn't won a trophy since 2017; a cataclysmic expanse for the club the size of it.

In the black and white of Newcastle, it is an even longer wait, having not won any major silverware for 54 years.

The PIF -- which has an 80% stake in the club, as part of a three-party consortium -- is a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, the man who a US intelligence report named responsible for approving the operation that led to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

With thousands of fans having made the journey down to London from Newcastle for the final, Wembley's atmosphere had a proper cup final feel to it.

And to the delight of Manchester United fans, their local hero and the team's man in form, Rashford, was declared fit to start despite a recent injury scare. Newcastle was without its own star player in goalkeeper Nick Pope who had been shown a red card in his previous game meaning he was suspended.

In the opening few minutes, and in a crackling atmosphere, there was very little between the two teams, with Newcastle's Allan Saint-Maximin going closest after some trademark quick footwork.

When it looked as if Newcastle might be building up a head of steam, it was sucker punched when a free kick from out wide was headed past Karius by Casemiro.

Casemiro celebrates scoring Manchester United's first goal in the Carabao Cup final.

The Brazilian midfielder was signed by manager Ten Hag in a £60 million ($73m) deal from Real Madrid in the summer and his impact as the heart of the team has been indicative of Manchester United's rise since Ten Hag's arrival at the club.

Things went from bad to worse for Newcastle minutes later when some neat link up play between Rashford and Wout Weghorst saw the England star played into the opposition's box. Although he was able to get away a left-footed shot under pressure from Botman, Rashford's shot looked to have been heading wide meaning the goal was credited to the Netherlands defender.

After the halftime break, Newcastle ramped up its pressure on David de Gea's goal, with Saint-Maximin and the newly-introduced Alexander Isak doing their best to fashion goalscoring opportunities.

The final two minutes were filled with set pieces, substitutions and breakaway chances -- with Manchester United actually looking the most likely to score.

In the dying seconds, with the result seemingly wrapped up, Portugal international Fernandes had a glorious opportunity to cap off a memorable afternoon, only for Karius to produce a smart stop.

Rashford celebrates after Manchester United's second goal in the Carabao Cup final.

In the end, Manchester United was able to run down the remainder of the clock, end its six-year trophy wait -- the club's longest wait for a major trophy since 1983 -- and possibly usher in a new era at the club.

""It's a mixture of all the emotions. It's massive for us to be involved in these types of games. it's something we've missed as a club,"" Rashford told Sky Sports afterwards.

""The fact we've come all this way and won it, it's a massive feeling. Hopefully it pushes us now to keep going. There's hunger to add more finals like this. I've been in finals where we've won and lost. It's massive for us as a club and individuals and it's part of our history. We want to keep adding to that.""

He added: ""We want to be involved in a lot of games and that means we've got to stay in the competitions. If we want to win things, we have to keep pushing.""

For Newcastle, it was yet more disappointment at Wembley as it has now lost each of its last nine matches at the stadium, a run that began in the 1974 FA Cup final, extending what is the longest ever losing run by a club side at the venue.",['Ben Morse'],2023-02-26

135,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/24/sport/boxing-olympics-chaos-iba-usa-spt-intl,Infighting in the sport and Russia's invasion of Ukraine leaves Olympic boxing on the ropes,"(CNN) It's an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible ""sabotage,"" saying the IBA had announced a ""false and misleading"" qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women's and men's world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA's running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the ""ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.""

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to ""come together and work together as a unit"" so it can ""continue to fight for our Olympic future.""

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be ""fundamental change"" before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body's decision was ""taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.""

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA's ""financial dependency"" on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the ""continuing and very concerning issues"" over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been ""dealing with significant governance issues,"" which it said were a ""burden from the past leadership.""

""We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC's upper echelon,"" the statement added.

""This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.""

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women's and men's world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be ""main qualification events"" for Paris 2024.

The IBA's announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation's banners -- or competing in general -- in many sports following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin's troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as ""neutral athletes.""

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other ""like-minded"" countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries -- including the UK, Canada and most of Europe -- said in a joint statement that there is ""no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.""

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the ""Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.""

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to ""use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.""

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

(Left to right) Silver medalist Pat McCormack, gold medalist Cuba's Roniel Iglesias and bronze medalists Russian Olympic Committee's Andrei Zamkovoi and Ireland's Aidan Walsh celebrate on the podium after the men's welterweight boxing final at the 2020 Olympics.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA's announcement, saying ""the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024's boxing qualifications and tournament.""

The statement said the IBA's suspension was ""still in force"" and that ""the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.""

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA's announcement of qualifying tournaments ""totally unacceptable"" and said it ""clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.""

""IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,"" he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained ""committed to the Olympic movement"" by following the IOC's principles of ""proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.""

On Wednesday, Ukraine's boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA's world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men's and women's championships.

""Our answer is clear -- our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,"" Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

Ilchenko added: ""As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country ... they will not participate.""",['Ben Morse'],2023-02-24
136,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/26/us/aaron-rodgers-darkness-retreat-wellness-ctpr,NFL star Aaron Rodgers went to a darkness retreat to contemplate his future. What is that and how does it work?,"(CNN) For four days this week, home for Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was a pitch-black room. There were no phones, no television, no lights or distractions. Just Rodgers, alone with his thoughts, in a cabin built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark.

When the four-time NFL MVP announced plans earlier this month to contemplate his NFL future in isolation at a ""darkness retreat,"" many were left scratching their heads.

""It's just sitting in isolation, meditation, dealing with your thoughts,"" Rodgers said earlier this month . ""We rarely even turn our phone off or put the blinds down to sleep in darkness. I'm really looking forward to it.""

Rodgers is no stranger to alternative therapies. He credits psychedelics like psilocybin and ayahuasca for helping to alleviate his fear of death and deepening a sense of self-love. The football star said he has done ""many meditation and yoga retreats"" in the past and defended his decision to try darkness therapy as one of several practices ""that have stimulated my mind and helped me get in a better headspace and have a greater peace in my life.""

But what exactly happens in a darkness retreat? And is it just another new-age fad or perhaps something that could benefit the rest of us?

What happens in the dark

A darkness retreat is exactly what it sounds like: a prolonged stay in a space completely devoid of light. One of the centers offering the practice is Sky Cave Retreats , nestled in the Cascade-Siskiyou wilderness, in Southern Oregon, near Klamath Falls.

The cabins are built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark.

""The reasons for doing this range from people wanting to know themselves more, to people who want to rest, reset and relax, to those who want to explore consciousness and deepen their meditation practice,"" said Scott Berman, who owns Sky Cave Retreats along with his wife Jill, adding the darkness helps illuminate what really matters by stripping away the constant bombardment of sensory input and stimulation many people experience in their hectic modern lives.

""When someone goes into the darkness, all these things that were important to them like money, fame, power, status, being worthy -- they all become insignificant and meaningless in the dark,"" Berman said. ""In the dark, all you have is the present moment which reveals what is truly meaningful -- whether it's love, forgiveness, peace -- and it begins to transform you as you truly authentically touch what is most important to you.""

The center currently operates three stand-alone cabins built specifically for prolonged isolation in the dark -- earth-sheltered caves, which on the outside are somewhat reminiscent of a Hobbit home. Each space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation. Participants can leave at any time -- the doors are never locked -- and there is a light switch for emergencies which is protected by a childproof guard so it isn't flipped on by accident.

The cost includes three meals a day, which Berman delivers personally all at once in the evening (through a lightproof double-sided food box) to minimize the disturbance. This is when participants have an opportunity for a conversation, which could be 10 seconds or 30 minutes, according to Berman, depending on the person's needs.

Participants typically spend three to four days in the darkness at a cost of $250 a night and are encouraged to take an extra day before and after to integrate the experience.

Each space contains a bed, a toilet, sink and a bathtub, as well as a low table for eating and a carpeted area for yoga and meditation.

Burak Dalcik, a 27-year-old salesman from Arlington, Virginia, said the four days he spent in the dark at Sky Caves Retreats in January gave him clarity about his priorities. He found he no longer labeled experiences as positive or negative, but rather allowed them to come and to go, which led to less stress and anxiety at work and in his personal life. He also said he started calling his mom, who lives back in Turkey, more frequently.

""It just really trims all the unnecessary fat and allows you to focus on some of the most important things and really allows you to understand who you are,"" said Dalcik. ""There's nothing New Age about this -- it boils down to can you just sit by yourself with yourself? And if you can't, you should probably get pretty curious about why.""

Berman cautions the retreat isn't for everyone, nor should it be seen as a quick fix to one's troubles.

""It's not like this magical, mind-blowing, amazing experience -- it can be extremely difficult and uncomfortable,"" Berman said. ""But in the darkness, discomfort is the door to transformation. There's an acceptance and a profound love that people start to experience when they're no longer resisting that part of themselves.""

A therapeutic tool or junk science?

For now, there is limited research on how darkness retreats impact the human brain and body. Some centers claim the experience can help heal traumas or activate the pineal gland, another claim is darkness therapy increases melatonin production in the brain.

""That's totally false,"" said Dr. David Blask, the head of the Laboratory of Chrono-Neuroendocrine Oncology at Tulane University School of Medicine. ""There may be some psychological benefits that people derive from a darkness retreat that they feel are important for them, but certainly not from a strict endocrine neuroendocrine or biochemical physiological standpoint.""

Dr. Marek Malůš, a psychologist at the University of Ostrava in the Czech Republic who has been studying darkness therapies since 2010, sees the technique as a promising therapeutic tool.

""Your thoughts, memories, emotions, inner world and mental processes become much more balanced and integrated,"" Malůš said.

While he and his colleagues are working to secure funding for additional studies, Malůš said preliminary research showed just four days in a darkness chamber was enough to help increase mindfulness and self-esteem, lower symptoms of depression and anxiety, while improving parasympathetic nervous system functions, which helps with stress management and lowering burnout symptoms. Subjects reported feeling the benefits three weeks after the experience.

Berman said he hopes to see more scientific research into the benefits of darkness retreats, but cautions against anyone seeking to use the retreat for some sort of natural high.

""If somebody's coming here because they want to have a so-called DMT experience, you've come into the wrong place,"" he said. ""But there is a lot of benefit in not looking outside of ourselves for confirmation of our worth and using the darkness to illuminate our true nature.""

For those who aren't able to commit the time or money for a darkness retreat but want a taste of some of the benefits, Berman suggests starting small at home.

""It's about becoming accustomed to authentically slowing down, putting the phone away, turning out the lights, closing the blinds and just resting,"" he said. ""Not to get somewhere, not to heal but just to be curious about what's actually happening within yourself.""",['Lucy Kafanov'],2023-02-26
137,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/22/football/palestianian-national-soccer-team-world-cup-spt-intl,"All eyes were on Morocco at the last World Cup. Now, Palestinian national team wants a slice of the action at 2026 tournament","(CNN) The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory's presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting ""free Palestine,"" while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel's creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel's capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel's creation -- in what Palestinians call the ""Nakba"" and Israelis call Independence Day -- clashes have been frequent.

Rami Hamadeh plays for the Palestianian national team against Jordan at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, AFC Asian Cup.

""Nakba"" means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

""The Israeli occupation doesn't just affect me, but affects ... Palestinian sports in general,"" the Palestinian team's goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

""Whether it's players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.""

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian football player Mahmoud Sarsak, who staged a hunger strike of nearly three months while in Israeli jail, is surrounded by relatives and supporters at the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on July 10, 2012 upon his release from prison.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel's ""illegal combatant"" policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said ""I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.""

But last year's AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

""The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It's the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,"" the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes' movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was ""clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.""

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

Makram Daboub (C) became the Palestinian national team's official coach in 2021.

The politics of travel

Nicknamed the ""Lions of Canaan"" and the ""Fedayeen,"" the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

""Our training base is in the West Bank, and I'm able to watch the matches here. But I can't watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can't come to the West Bank either,"" said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

""Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,"" Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, ""Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.""

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team's official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

""We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,"" said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer's world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won't be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

Morocco's Ismail El Haddad and Palestinian Yaser Hamed contest the ball in an Arab Cup game in December 2021.

""I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,"" said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

'Love of football'

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup -- the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages -- Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

""When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it's from the Palestinian bloodline,"" Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain's national football team if he's called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

""I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I'm proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It's like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,"" said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

The PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad's first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players' health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

""To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,"" said Shaheen.

""The nutritional support that's added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,"" Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been ""shining"" in the Portuguese league.

Oday Dabbagh, who plays club football in Portugal, is pictured playing for the Palestinian national team against Song Kum Song of North Korea during the 2018 AFC Under-23 Championship in Jiangyin city, east China's Jiangsu province, in January 2018.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA -- he plays for Portugal's F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team's future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn't always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel's control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association's (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn't violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its ""FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.""

Additionally, FIFA's football infrastructure projects ""include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,"" according to FIFA.

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, back right, and President of the Palestine Olympic Committee Jibril Rajoub, second right, back, meet with young Palestinian athletes at Faisal Al-Husseini stadium in the West Bank city of Al-Ram, north of Jerusalem, in September 2022.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces ""won't stop us from our plans.""

""This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,"" said Hilal.

""There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it's known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,"" Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn't hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.

While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.

""There's a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,"" said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

""For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,""

Page then fought against American Logan Storley for the interim welterweight championship and lost, meaning Amosov fought Storley for the title at Bellator 291 in Dublin, Ireland on Saturday.

Amosov got a rapturous welcome when he walked to the cage wearing a yellow and blue t-shirt emblazoned with the words ""Colors of Freedom"" on it.

And he outclassed his US opponent throughout the evening, providing no areas of criticism as the judges all scored the fight in the Ukrainian's favor.

Afterwards, draped in an Ukrainian flag, Amosov dedicated the victory to his home country.

""Ukrainian people, I love you. I love you my people,"" Amosov said, with tears of emotion evident. ""Please do not forget what is happening.""

Amosov celebrates winning against Storley at Bellator 291.

Amosov's involvement in the war first became widely known in April last year, when a video he posted of himself recovering his world championship belt from the rubble of his home in Irpin went viral.

""It's a year since the big war started and for me it's a big motivation because I understand what happened and what's going on now in my country,"" a visibly emotional Amosov said at Thursday's press conference. ""I understand that it's been a very hard year for all Ukrainians.

""When the Russian soldiers left central Ukraine, I took my belt and many people -- my friends, my team, manager and coach -- told me: 'You must go and defend your belt. Now, your work is as a mediator -- you must win this fight, you must talk.'

Amosov punches Storley.

""So I want to talk about this but it's hard sometimes, for my country and me it's hard, but I understand I must do this.""

Amosov is one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world and, at 27-0, currently holds the longest active unbeaten streak in all of MMA, needing just three wins to equal Khabib Nurmagomedov's all-time record of 29-0.

Speaking exclusively to CNN from Irpin in May, Amosov recounted the horror and devastation Vladimir Putin's war has brought to his homeland. He described it as ""destruction.""

Amosov had returned home from a training camp in Thailand four days before the war began. Once Russian troops began advancing, Amosov says he took his wife and six-month-old son to safety on the outskirts of Ukraine before joining the territorial defense to aid civilians in and around Irpin.

""It's hard to look at your city that was once full of happiness, life,"" Amosov told CNN at the time. ""It was always very beautiful here, people were happy, they were happy with their life and took pleasure in it.

Amosov returned to fight in the war in Ukraine when Russia invaded.

""Then simply to look at the city now, which is on fire, which is getting destroyed and it becomes horrible to look at. You couldn't really go driving around the city because the roads were covered with trees, in some places, there were parts of houses. Destruction.""

According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), at least 8,006 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and 13,287 injured since the invasion began on February 24, 2022.

At least 487 children have been killed and 954 injured, but the OHCHR says the actual number of civilian casualties is ""considerably higher"" as reports of deaths and injuries in certain regions still cannot be corroborated.","['Matias Grez', 'Ben Morse']",2023-02-25

Not so for soccer star Alyssa Thompson , who had to think about the more pressing matter of her classes the next morning.

The 18-year-old Thompson made headlines when she was selected as the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NWSL draft by Angel City FC in January, becoming the first high schooler in history to be drafted in the history of the league.

""I was very nervous,"" she tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies.

""And just like all the emotions were coming to me at that moment. I just was really shocked and couldn't believe this is really happening right now.""

Not to be overwhelmed by her status as a new NWSL star, the senior at Harvard-Westlake is adamant that she is still focused on school, even if she has to juggle her studies with a professional soccer career.

""Once I'm done with practice, I don't have another thing to do. So I think I'll do my schoolwork,"" she says. ""As long as it gets me to graduate, I'll do it.""

Thompson is no stranger to balancing school and soccer -- whether its weekend trips to tournaments or training camps -- and in October she went one better, making her debut for the US Women's National Team in a friendly against European Champion England in London.

In front of a packed-out Wembley Stadium, Thompson was subbed on for USWNT superstar Megan Rapinoe, a moment that will stay with her for life.

Alyssa Thompson made her debut for the national team as a substitute for Megan Rapinoe.

""That was so crazy! I don't know how to describe it. I was just really nervous, and I was going in for Megan Rapinoe!"" she recalls. ""I don't think I was even processing it in the moment.""

Thompson will have to get used to lining up with the biggest stars in the sport. Angel City boasts a line-up of celebrity owners, including Serena Williams, Natalie Portman, Becky G, Eva Longoria and Mia Hamm.

And the stars are not limited to the sidelines. When the NWSL season kicks off next month, Thompson will be a part of an all-star team featuring two-time world champion Christen Press and Thompson's personal hero Sydney Leroux.

Inspiring on and off the field

Thompson is not only breaking records as the first high school No. 1 draft pick. She also became the first player of Peruvian and Filipino heritage to be picked at No. 1, something that is not lost on her.

Despite her youth, Thompson doesn't simply want to play soccer, but she also wants to be the inspiration for the next generation of girls playing the game.

""I think that being able to be a woman of color just as a role model for little girls is such an amazing thing,"" she tells CNN Sport. ""Being able to look up to someone that looks like them is such a cool thing to have.""

Thompson is used to being a role model having served as one for her younger sisters, Gisele and Zoe, her whole life. Both want to emulate Thompson's success.

Gisele is already on that path after becoming the first high school player, along with Alyssa, to sign a name, image and likeness deal with Nike. She also has emulated her older sister by playing for the USWNT youth teams, featuring at the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup.

Alyssa Thompson will hope make her debut for Angel City next month when the NWSL season kicks off.

The pair have been inseparable, playing together from when they could walk all the way to the present, where they have featured together for the Total Futbol Academy of MLS Next, a boys' team in Southern California.

Despite Thompson's youth, she already sees herself as far more than just an athlete -- someone who has the power to inspire a new generation of soccer players in the US.

""For my youngest sister, Zoe, being able to just be an inspiration for her and a role model for her to look up to, I think has really helped me put things into perspective for what I really want to do and how I want to be a role model for little kids,"" she says.

While making her NSWL debut in Los Angeles is first on Thompson's to-do list, the far bigger prize is in Australia and New Zealand in the shape of the Women's World Cup, which kicks off in July.

Having tasted international senior soccer in October and now training regularly with USWNT players at club level, Thompson is hungry to be a part of the biggest showpiece in women's soccer.

It's a tall order for the young striker. The US boasts the deepest pool of players to choose from of any team and is coming into the tournament as the reigning champion, albeit on a low ebb.

Both of Thompson's appearances for the team came in losses to England and Spain before the US lost to Germany, marking the first time the team has lost three games in a row since 1993.

Head coach Vlatko Andonovski has very little margin for error as he looks to lead the US to a third consecutive title and Thompson will have to seriously impress if she wants to make it onto the plane heading across the Pacific.

""I'm going to do everything that I can to be able to make the roster and I'm just going to work hard towards that goal,"" Thompson says.

""If I continue to grow as a player and continue to thrive in the NWSL environment, then I feel like I have a chance.""

A slim chance, maybe, but Thompson is no stranger to making the seemingly impossible look routine.","['Amanda Davies', 'Alasdair Howorth']",2023-02-25

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

""I enjoy those moments in the game when I'm just going after people,"" the NBA All-Star said after the game. ""That's all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.""

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell's 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting -- even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts -- just one off Klay Thompson's record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard's teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell's total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

""It really, really was a masterful performance,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star's game. ""It was a piece of art. That was incredible.""

Any postgame celebrations for Lillard were cut short after he was picked for a drug test.

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain's record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

""I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you're hot, you're in attack mode, you're feeling good,"" he said.

Not only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.

The Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.

Now, he wants to open the door for more people to come out","(CNN) During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with ""the best right shoulder in the game,"" according to one of his former coaches.

He played three times for the All Blacks -- a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand -- and represented club teams at home and overseas.

But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.

""I loved playing rugby,"" he tells CNN Sport . ""And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.

""That didn't fit the picture and that wasn't part of my plan. I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn't address it -- just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.""

Last month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.

The response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for ""blazing this trail"" and inspiring ""future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.""

""So many people have sent messages of support,"" says Johnstone. ""Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.

""In that respect, it's been really overwhelming and so positive.""

Johnstone played for the Ospreys in Wales, as well as clubs in New Zealand and France.

On top of his three Tests for the All Blacks in 2005, Johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for Canterbury and 38 times for the Crusaders. He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.

Now, the 43-year-old says he is ""at peace"" in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn't believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.

""It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,"" says Johnstone. ""Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn't be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.

""I'd go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I'd go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I'd come home and realize that I'm not actually being truthful to my teammates.""

Former referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.

Both Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer , who came out as gay in 2020, said he ""routinely numbed"" himself with a ""heavy cocktail of opioids"" during his playing career.

But Johnstone is optimistic about rugby's future.

""As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it'll progress very well,"" he says.

""I think rugby is a living culture and it's always progressing and it's progressing in the right directions.""

Johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days -- largely because he's always been a private person and ""wasn't 100% comfortable"" with his sexuality at the time.

He's now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.

""I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: 'Yeah, okay, let's address it and take away that stigma,' because there's always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.

""If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.""

After retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.

He recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team -- something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.

""That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,"" says Johnstone, ""and you'll get better results, I believe.""",['George Ramsay'],2023-02-23

Now, Palestinian national team wants a slice of the action at 2026 tournament","(CNN) The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory's presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting ""free Palestine,"" while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel's creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel's capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel's creation -- in what Palestinians call the ""Nakba"" and Israelis call Independence Day -- clashes have been frequent.

Rami Hamadeh plays for the Palestianian national team against Jordan at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, AFC Asian Cup.

""Nakba"" means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

""The Israeli occupation doesn't just affect me, but affects ... Palestinian sports in general,"" the Palestinian team's goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

""Whether it's players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.""

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian football player Mahmoud Sarsak, who staged a hunger strike of nearly three months while in Israeli jail, is surrounded by relatives and supporters at the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on July 10, 2012 upon his release from prison.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel's ""illegal combatant"" policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said ""I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.""

But last year's AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

""The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It's the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,"" the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes' movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was ""clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.""

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

Makram Daboub (C) became the Palestinian national team's official coach in 2021.

Nicknamed the ""Lions of Canaan"" and the ""Fedayeen,"" the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

""Our training base is in the West Bank, and I'm able to watch the matches here. But I can't watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can't come to the West Bank either,"" said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

""Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,"" Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, ""Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.""

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team's official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

""We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,"" said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer's world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won't be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

Morocco's Ismail El Haddad and Palestinian Yaser Hamed contest the ball in an Arab Cup game in December 2021.

""I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,"" said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

'Love of football'

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup -- the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages -- Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

""When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it's from the Palestinian bloodline,"" Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain's national football team if he's called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

""I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I'm proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It's like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,"" said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

The PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad's first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players' health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

""To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,"" said Shaheen.

""The nutritional support that's added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,"" Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been ""shining"" in the Portuguese league.

Oday Dabbagh, who plays club football in Portugal, is pictured playing for the Palestinian national team against Song Kum Song of North Korea during the 2018 AFC Under-23 Championship in Jiangyin city, east China's Jiangsu province, in January 2018.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA -- he plays for Portugal's F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team's future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn't always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel's control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association's (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn't violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its ""FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.""

Additionally, FIFA's football infrastructure projects ""include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,"" according to FIFA.

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, back right, and President of the Palestine Olympic Committee Jibril Rajoub, second right, back, meet with young Palestinian athletes at Faisal Al-Husseini stadium in the West Bank city of Al-Ram, north of Jerusalem, in September 2022.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces ""won't stop us from our plans.""

""This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,"" said Hilal.

""There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it's known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,"" Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn't hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.

While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.

""There's a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,"" said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

""For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,""

Coach Daboub goes even further.

150,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/24/sport/boxing-olympics-chaos-iba-usa-spt-intl,Infighting in the sport and Russia's invasion of Ukraine leaves Olympic boxing on the ropes,"(CNN) It's an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible ""sabotage,"" saying the IBA had announced a ""false and misleading"" qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women's and men's world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

Andy Cruz of Team Cuba dodges a punch from Keyshawn Davis of Team USA during the men's lightweight final at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA's running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the ""ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.""

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to ""come together and work together as a unit"" so it can ""continue to fight for our Olympic future.""

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be ""fundamental change"" before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body's decision was ""taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.""

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA's ""financial dependency"" on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the ""continuing and very concerning issues"" over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been ""dealing with significant governance issues,"" which it said were a ""burden from the past leadership.""

""We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC's upper echelon,"" the statement added.

""This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.""

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women's and men's world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be ""main qualification events"" for Paris 2024.

The IBA's announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation's banners -- or competing in general -- in many sports following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin's troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as ""neutral athletes.""

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other ""like-minded"" countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries -- including the UK, Canada and most of Europe -- said in a joint statement that there is ""no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.""

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the ""Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.""

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to ""use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.""

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA's announcement, saying ""the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024's boxing qualifications and tournament.""

The statement said the IBA's suspension was ""still in force"" and that ""the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.""

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA's announcement of qualifying tournaments ""totally unacceptable"" and said it ""clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.""

""IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,"" he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained ""committed to the Olympic movement"" by following the IOC's principles of ""proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.""

On Wednesday, Ukraine's boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA's world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men's and women's championships.

""Our answer is clear -- our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,"" Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

Ilchenko added: ""As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country ... they will not participate.""",['Ben Morse'],2023-02-24

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

""I enjoy those moments in the game when I'm just going after people,"" the NBA All-Star said after the game. ""That's all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.""

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell's 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting -- even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts -- just one off Klay Thompson's record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard's teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell's total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

""It really, really was a masterful performance,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star's game. ""It was a piece of art. That was incredible.""

Any postgame celebrations for Lillard were cut short after he was picked for a drug test.

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain's record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

""I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you're hot, you're in attack mode, you're feeling good,"" he said.

Not only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.

The Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.

Because not just once, but twice during his third round, American golfer Akshay Bhatia was forced into an impromptu wardrobe change at the PGA National Resort in Palm Beach, Florida.

The first came at the sixth hole, when the 21-year-old's tee drive settled in the muddy banks on the left of the fairway. A shirtless shot followed as Bhatia successfully scooped his ball back onto the fairway, the splashes of mud across his chest suggesting that the shirt removal was a smart decision.

A superb approach and putt saw the world No. 357 save par superbly, yet despite the best efforts of his caddie and a towel, the hole had left its mark on Bhatia. Fortunately, his girlfriend was on hand with a change of clothes, and the golfer pushed on with his round.

Bhatia tracks his shot from the sixth hole.

Bhatia had been riding the wave of an excellent second round, but effectively saw any chance of a first PGA Tour victory collapse across four holes. A run of bogey, par, double bogey and bogey saw Bhatia arrive at the par-three 15th hole needing a big response, only for his tee shot to sail over the flag and into the swampy area behind the green.

""Mr. Cross was diagnosed during life with mild cognitive impairment and was found at autopsy to have stage 4 chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is the most severe type of the disease,"" said Dr. Ann McKee, director of Boston University's CTE Center, in a statement. ""He is one of the 345 former NFL players diagnosed with CTE by the BU CTE Center and UNITE brain bank team out of 376 former NFL players studied.""

Former players studied by the BU CTE Center have chosen to donate their brains to the center or have had their brains donated by their families after their deaths.

CTE, a neurodegenerative brain disease, can be found in individuals who have been exposed to repeated head trauma. Studies have found that repetitive hits to the head -- even without concussion -- can result in CTE.

The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, is pathologically marked by a buildup of tau protein in the brain that can disable neuropathways and lead to a variety of symptoms including memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, aggression, depression, anxiety, impulse control issues and sometimes suicidal behavior.

166,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/16/sport/lesley-paterson-all-quiet-on-the-western-front-film-triathlon-spt-intl,How a world champion triathlete earned an Oscar nomination,"(CNN) It's while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.

A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.

She counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.

The film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer -- a young army recruit and the story's protagonist -- notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.

Unbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.

""It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film -- that the uniform's more important than the man,"" Paterson tells CNN Sport

""It's just one of those moments where you know it's good and you think: 'Oh my God ... where did this come from?' You feel so lucky that you've thought of it.""

The scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment

""If we can hold up a mirror to what's going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller -- to effect change,"" says Paterson.

Felix Kammerer stars as Paul Bäumer in ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""

First portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, ""All Quiet"" focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.

Paterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.

The end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world's first mechanized war in chilling detail.

It has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations -- including for best adapted screenplay -- and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations

The BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 -- two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.

A five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.

That was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.

With the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.

""I do a lot of one-arm drills,"" says Paterson. ""I was always really good at it and I've got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: 'Well, I can do one arm, let's give this a shot.'""

After finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.

""I just kind of kept on going,"" she says. ""And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.""

Triathlete Lesley Paterson competes for Great Britain in Birmingham, Alabama, in 2012.

The experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.

""I don't know if that's the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it's just truly I'm driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,"" she says. ""I'm a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.""

Paterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series -- ""all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,"" she says -- having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.

After she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in -- and winning -- races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get ""All Quiet"" off the ground.

""Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it's a lot of money,"" says Paterson.

""Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn't necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.""

Over the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she's doing and an obsessive attention to detail.

""I've always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,"" says Paterson.

""People think they are often very separate, but they're actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I'd say that I truly am the athlete I am because I'm an artist and the artist I am because I'm an athlete.""

""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed.

Whether it's sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of ""looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.""

It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 -- the only girl in a team of boys -- and why she chose to tackle ""All Quiet"" at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.

The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes' ""1917"" four years ago.

And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching ""All Quiet"" in German, rather than English.

""There's an authenticity -- it's their story, it's their national novel, it's rightly so that it's in German,"" says Paterson.

The popularity of ""All Quiet"" may take Paterson's life in a different direction, especially now that she's 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.

Whatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.

""It's focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes -- that was a huge learning curve for me,"" she says.

""As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you're at ... That's where the beauty comes.""",['George Ramsay'],2023-02-16

Now, he wants to open the door for more people to come out","(CNN) During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with ""the best right shoulder in the game,"" according to one of his former coaches.

He played three times for the All Blacks -- a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand -- and represented club teams at home and overseas.

But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.

""I loved playing rugby,"" he tells CNN Sport . ""And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.

""That didn't fit the picture and that wasn't part of my plan. I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn't address it -- just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.""

Last month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.

The response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for ""blazing this trail"" and inspiring ""future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.""

""So many people have sent messages of support,"" says Johnstone. ""Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.

""In that respect, it's been really overwhelming and so positive.""

Johnstone played for the Ospreys in Wales, as well as clubs in New Zealand and France.

On top of his three Tests for the All Blacks in 2005, Johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for Canterbury and 38 times for the Crusaders. He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.

Now, the 43-year-old says he is ""at peace"" in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn't believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.

""It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,"" says Johnstone. ""Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn't be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.

""I'd go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I'd go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I'd come home and realize that I'm not actually being truthful to my teammates.""

Former referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.

Both Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer , who came out as gay in 2020, said he ""routinely numbed"" himself with a ""heavy cocktail of opioids"" during his playing career.

But Johnstone is optimistic about rugby's future.

""As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it'll progress very well,"" he says.

""I think rugby is a living culture and it's always progressing and it's progressing in the right directions.""

Johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days -- largely because he's always been a private person and ""wasn't 100% comfortable"" with his sexuality at the time.

He's now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.

""I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: 'Yeah, okay, let's address it and take away that stigma,' because there's always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.

""If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.""

After retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.

He recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team -- something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.

""That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,"" says Johnstone, ""and you'll get better results, I believe.""",['George Ramsay'],2023-02-23

The inside story of the Super League and the war for soccer's soul,"(CNN) Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming -- just ask Julius Caesar, who asked ""Et tu Brute?"" as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition -- the Champions League -- are akin to a 'House of Cards' plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe's biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body's UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams -- the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary ""Super League: The War for Football,"" the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a ""political thriller ... 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,"" its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles -- or its future -- and, most stingingly of all, ""betrayal"" between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter's godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was ""sort of the general of the opposing army,"" Zimbalist says.

""The dynamics at play here aren't that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,"" he adds. ""The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.""

Aleksander Čeferin was elected UEFA President in 2016.

Characters -- normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews -- are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother's death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez's about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi's about his tennis playing days.

""This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,"" Zimbalist says. ""These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

""We were watching what's usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.""

'Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?'

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs -- all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to ""drop a legislative bomb"" to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

Andrea Agnelli was replaced by Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the chairman of the European Club Association.

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects' reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

""That was how we presented it to them,"" Zimbalist says.

""We're going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they're rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.""

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

""You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,"" he says. ""But then you're leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.""

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport's most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football's magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

Real Madrid won the 2022 Champions League.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

""This identity crisis in the sport -- is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?"" Zimbalist says. ""If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn't fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.""

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the ""cynical project,"" as seemingly, did football's world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA's more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

'The war for football rages on'

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with ""60 to 80 teams"" earlier this month.

Zimbalist's documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by ""old money"" clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by ""new money"" club such as PSG and Manchester City.

""We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,"" he says.

""And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?""

Giorgio Marchetti is the Deputy General Secretary of UEFA.

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team's representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors -- including Agnelli -- resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor's office in Turin.

Barcelona's already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become ""a reality in 2025.""

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN's Richard Quest last month that for them, ""the Super League is in the past.""

""It was something that we apologized for and ... going forward, it's not something that we're interested in.""

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league's fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the ""ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,"" Zimbalist says.

""Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.""",['Issy Ronald'],2023-02-27

Here's how it could happen","During the Lakers' 27-point comeback victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, TV cameras caught LeBron James saying he heard his foot ""pop"" when landing from a layup. The 38-year-old was seen walking gingerly after the game despite being able to finish the win.

Just as the Lakers seem to be building some momentum with a three-game winning streak, with their stars shining and the new additions playing their part, James looks set to be in for a spell on the sidelines.

Multiple reports say the 19-time All-Star could miss several weeks, but is awaiting further tests to determine the full extent of the injury.

James posted a photo of his injured foot to his Instagram story on Monday, after it was announced he would miss the match against the Memphis Grizzlies, along with the caption: ""Fkn sucks!!!!""

Just another day in 'Laker Land' -- and it couldn't have come at a worse time.

With 21 games remaining and sitting two spots outside of a spot in the postseason's play-in tournament -- and six spots away from automatic qualification to the playoffs -- the Lakers remain in danger of missing the playoffs for the second successive season. Or will we see those famous yellow and purple uniforms in the NBA's business end of the season?

Steadily improving

For such a storied franchise and one which was crowned NBA champion just over two years ago, this season has been one full of questions and arguably not one coming up with the right answers.

Heading into the season, general manager Rob Pelinka had his work cut out to round out the team's roster, even with superstars like James and Anthony Davis on the books -- all with limited draft capital largely thanks to the widely criticized trade for Russell Westbrook.

The acquisition of Patrick Beverley in August filled a need but many pundits believed that the Lakers had not done enough to put themselves in contention to compete for a title.

Criticism from fans and pundits was even louder because of the finite amount of time it appears James has left at the top level as he approaches 40 and Pelinka's inability to build a contender around arguably the NBA's greatest player.

So the season began as many predicted, with the Lakers winning just two of their first 12 games. On November 12, the Lakers were 14th in the Western Conference.

To the credit of first-year head coach Darvin Ham and the team's leading players, the Lakers dug themselves out of a hole, winning eight of their next 10 games.

But down to a combination of injuries, lack of consistency and a lopsided roster, the Lakers struggled to kick on and make a serious surge up the standings or show their championship mettle.

Midseason trades seemed to address some of the team's issues of a lack of defense and shooting from the perimeter -- Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt, Mo Bamba and Davon Reed arriving, while Westbrook was finally shipped out.

After Sunday's win over the Mavericks, Dallas head coach Jason Kidd said Vanderbilt ""kicked our a*s.""

Since the two trades on February 9, the team has gone 4-2 and seemingly turned its season on its head.

James shoots while Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics defends.

What are chances of the Lakers in the playoffs?

In any NBA season until 2020, the Lakers' chances of competing in the playoffs would be seriously diminished with only eight teams qualifying.

But following the introduction of the play-in tournament during the bubble season in the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, a postseason berth is still within the team's grasp.

The play-in tournament whittles down the teams ranked seventh to 10th in each conference to determine the final two spots in the playoffs. The seventh seeded team hosts the eighth, with the winner earning the No. 7 seed in the playoffs.

The ninth seeded team hosts the 10th ranked side, with the winner facing the loser of the game between the seventh and eighth seeds; the winner of this game will get the eighth and final spot in the playoff bracket.

It means that at the time of writing, the Lakers are currently on a three-game winning streak, have a record of 29-32 and sit 12th in the Western Conference; a game outside the play-in tournament. They are only two-and-a-half games outside of the sixth spot which would qualify them automatically for the playoffs.

According to the website Tankathon which measures the difficulty of a team's remaining schedule for the rest of the season, the Lakers have the fifth easiest slate of games left.

It has been a far from perfect season for the Lakers so far, but it appears as if they might be coming into some form after the All-Star break.

Tied in the win column with a similarly imperfect Portland Trail Blazers, we could well be seeing the 17-time NBA champion duking it out in the play-in -- James' injury permitting.

177,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/golf/chris-kirk-alcoholism-depression-honda-classic-spt-intl,Chris Kirk battled alcoholism and depression -- now he has secured his first PGA Tour victory in seven years,"(CNN) It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour. Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday, that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind.

A nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American's fifth PGA Tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.

""I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety,"" Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort.

""I wouldn't be doing this for a living anymore. I probably wouldn't have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.

""For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.

""It's something that's constantly on my mind, so it's pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.""

Kirk during the final round.

'I got sober because of you'

On the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019, Kirk announced he would be taking an ""indefinite leave"" from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.

""I thought I could control it, but after multiple relapses, I have come to realize I can't fix this on my own,"" Kirk added in a social media post.

By that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.

A tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk's sole top-40 finish of the campaign.

When he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further -- he was world No. 303 -- but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.

candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer's previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.

Kirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to ""accelerate"" his alcohol issues.

For Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.

Kirk is congratulated by his caddie after victory.

""It's been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, 'I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],"" Kirk said.

""When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more ... for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.

""So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.

""But now on the back end a little bit, it's been amazing. Like I said, it's not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and ... for somebody to say, 'I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,' you can't really describe how unreal that is with words.""

Augusta calling

On Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.

The American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot -- ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event -- who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.

For both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.

Again, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.

When Cole's birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip's hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.

As well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday's triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.

""I've been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that's going to be something that's incredibly special,"" Kirk said.

""That par-3 contest can't come soon enough. I'm really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.""

On Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.

""It'll be a lot of celebrating, and I thank God that alcohol won't be a part of it,"" Kirk said.",['Jack Bantock'],2023-02-27

182,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/16/sport/lesley-paterson-all-quiet-on-the-western-front-film-triathlon-spt-intl,How a world champion triathlete earned an Oscar nomination,"(CNN) It's while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.

A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.

She counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.

The film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer -- a young army recruit and the story's protagonist -- notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.

Unbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.

""It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film -- that the uniform's more important than the man,"" Paterson tells CNN Sport

""It's just one of those moments where you know it's good and you think: 'Oh my God ... where did this come from?' You feel so lucky that you've thought of it.""

The scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment

""If we can hold up a mirror to what's going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller -- to effect change,"" says Paterson.

Felix Kammerer stars as Paul Bäumer in ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""

First portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, ""All Quiet"" focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.

Paterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.

The end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world's first mechanized war in chilling detail.

It has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations -- including for best adapted screenplay -- and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations

The BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 -- two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.

A five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.

That was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.

With the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.

""I do a lot of one-arm drills,"" says Paterson. ""I was always really good at it and I've got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: 'Well, I can do one arm, let's give this a shot.'""

After finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.

""I just kind of kept on going,"" she says. ""And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.""

Triathlete Lesley Paterson competes for Great Britain in Birmingham, Alabama, in 2012.

The experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.

""I don't know if that's the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it's just truly I'm driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,"" she says. ""I'm a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.""

Paterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series -- ""all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,"" she says -- having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.

After she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in -- and winning -- races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get ""All Quiet"" off the ground.

""Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it's a lot of money,"" says Paterson.

""Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn't necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.""

Over the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she's doing and an obsessive attention to detail.

""I've always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,"" says Paterson.

""People think they are often very separate, but they're actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I'd say that I truly am the athlete I am because I'm an artist and the artist I am because I'm an athlete.""

""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was released last year and has been highly acclaimed.

Whether it's sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of ""looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.""

It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 -- the only girl in a team of boys -- and why she chose to tackle ""All Quiet"" at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.

The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes' ""1917"" four years ago.

And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching ""All Quiet"" in German, rather than English.

""There's an authenticity -- it's their story, it's their national novel, it's rightly so that it's in German,"" says Paterson.

The popularity of ""All Quiet"" may take Paterson's life in a different direction, especially now that she's 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.

Last year's final was delayed by more than 35 minutes after Liverpool fans struggled to enter the Stade de France and tear gas was used by French police towards supporters held in tightly packed areas.

There was widespread criticism about the way fans were treated at the game, with UK Member of Parliament Ian Byrne -- who was at the match as a Liverpool fan -- describing the situation outside the stadium as ""one of the most horrendous experiences of my life.""

A UEFA statement on the refund said: ""UEFA will implement a special refund scheme for fans who were most affected when accessing the Stade de France on 28 May 2022.

The 32-year-old has no children of his own, but the four glistening trophies displayed in his home are equally cherished all the same.

The matching pairs of US Open and PGA Championships cups were all scooped in an unprecedented stretch between 2017 and 2019 that saw the American become the first golfer in history to win back-to-back titles in two different majors concurrently. Before Koepka, nobody had ever won their first four majors inside two years.

It means that, of the eight PGA Tour wins he has to his name, half are major triumphs. For Koepka, it's a ratio he is more than content with.

""Nothing quite feels the same, the majors are so different. It's the pinnacle of our sport, it's what you're judged by,"" Koepka told CNN.

""If you look at all the greats that have ever played this game, most people can't tell you how many PGA Tour events or how many European Tour events this person's won or that person's won, but they know exactly how many majors you've won.

""So, to me, that's what you're defined by.""

'I love it when athletes get cocky'

They are words that make for tough reading for the host of supremely talented golfers who never clinched, or are still chasing, a major win. With 11 runner-up finishes between them, Colin Montgomerie, Lee Westwood, and Rickie Fowler are just three acclaimed players for whom majors have proved elusive despite a plethora of professional wins.

Koepka has previously explained how majors are the easiest tournaments to win. It's a characteristic candidness that he makes no apologies for. In fact, he sees it as a strength.

""I'm pretty blunt, I don't like beating around the bush. I just say it how it is, I've always been that way,"" he said. ""I know my monotone can come off a little bit of a pain in the butt for people, but that's how I feel.

""I love it when athletes get cocky or confident in themselves -- I think that's important. Everybody needs that, no matter what profession, no matter what you're doing.

""If you feel you're the best then go ahead and say it and then just go back it up.""

Koepka poses with the Wanamaker Trophy after capturing his second PGA Championship title in 2019.

And Koepka has certainly backed it up. The Floridian has finished inside the top-five in 12 of his 34 career major starts, including three runner-up finishes.

Only five times has he missed the cut, and two of those came during an excruciating season last year.

Koepka's current Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) No. 85 status is the lowest position he has held since 2014 -- albeit with the caveat of his involvement in the LIV Golf Series which, due its exclusion from the OWGR weighting system, has adversely affected the ranking of players who have joined the Saudi-backed series.

Injury woes have compounded a painful fall from the summit for the former World No. 1. After tearing the patella tendon in his left knee in 2019, Koepka revealed this past October that he had ""dislocated and shattered"" his right knee in 2021. The injuries were so severe that the American wondered if his career was over.

His struggle to come to terms with his loss of form was laid bare in Netflix's new fly-on-the-wall golf documentary series ""Full Swing,"" where Koepka admitted his slump was ""the worst"" he had ever suffered in his life.

""There was a lot of stuff ... just in (my) personal life, had gone on. A lot of down times, man,"" Koepka told CNN.

""The injuries, you look back at it and a lot of time you're just sitting there. There's a lot of pain, a lot of stuff you've just got to endure, just to make it better. It's not always fun, not always glamorous.""

Koepka struggled for form during 2022.

Health is wealth

Yet Koepka still carries good memories of 2022, namely his marriage to Jena Sims and a cathartic win at the final individual event of the LIV Golf Invitational Series in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in October.

Alongside brother Chase, he also secured victory in the corresponding team event. Given Koepka had promised to buy his younger sibling a Lamborghini if they won, it put a dent in his $4 million individual winner's earnings, but ultimately ensured a happy ending to a disappointing campaign.

Brooks and Chase Koepka toast their victory at the LIV Golf Invitiational - Jeddah.

""To be able to finally have some happy times, some success with all the down stuff, it was very enjoyable ... something I can really, really look back on,"" Koepka said.

""I could feel the trend coming upwards, (during) the middle of the year -- I was getting out of the funk and just happy to be out of it now.

""Hopefully put all that stuff behind me and stay healthy for a while, that's the goal.""

Naturally though, that isn't Koepka's only goal for 2023. A self-confessed ""slow starter,"" he is looking to be up to speed by the time The Masters rolls around in April.

Runner-up to Tiger Woods in 2019, a green jacket would put Koepka on track for what he considers to be a ""good"" 2023.

192,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/02/motorsport/fernando-alonso-formula-one-aston-martin-spt-intl,Fernando Alonso still hungry for success after joining 'ambitious' Aston Martin,"(CNN) More than 20 years after his Formula One debut, Fernando Alonso is as hungry as ever ahead of the start of the 2023 season, which gets underway on Friday at the Bahrain Grand Prix.

That desire for success led him to make the seismic decision last year to reject a new contract with Alpine to join Aston Martin, he tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies.

""It has to be an ambitious project. It has to be a project that wants to win, a project that will take anything and will do everything to make it happen. And that is what I feel in Aston Martin,"" the Spaniard said ahead of the season's start.

""There is this talent and this hunger for success, success and success.""

Success certainly comes naturally to the 41-year-old Spaniard. Having exploded onto the F1 scene in 2001, he won his first race in 2003 before winning back-to-back championships in 2005 and 2006, becoming the youngest double champion in the sport's history.

Since then, the winner of 32 races has had legendary battles with some of the best drivers of the last two decades, from Michael Schumacher and Kimi Räikkönen through to Lewis Hamilton and Sebastien Vettel, who Alonso has replaced at Aston Martin after the four-time champion retired from F1.

Aston Martin is Alonso's fifth team and the first move he has made since he returned to F1 with Alpine in 2021.

The frustration of the 2010s led to the Spaniard calling quits on his F1 career in 2018, retiring after five years without a race win and seemingly disillusioned with the sport.

He competed in the IndyCar Series, Le Mans' 24-hour race and the Dakar Rally, where he emerged unscathed from a crash in which his Toyota Hilux flew through the air after hitting a sand dune in Saudi Arabia.

Alonso won his first drivers' Championship in 2005 before retaining the title in 2006.

Three years later he made his sensational return to F1, but failed to hit the heights of his early career.

After finishing 10th in 2021 and ninth in 2022 with Alpine, Alonso turned down a one-year contract extension to join an Aston Martin team on its way up.

""The investment is there, the new facilities, new wind tunnel coming out. New people, joining the team from different experiences and different backgrounds,"" he says of Aston Martin's ""wonderful project.""

The investment is certainly there. Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin's boss and the father of Alonso's new partner, Lance, has put the money where his mouth is.

The team launched its new $200 million factory at Silverstone and broke the bank to bring in the best engineers and talent from other teams to support its new star driver.

With the new investment and Alonso's terrific performance at pre-season testing -- where he came second on the first day of testing in Bahrain -- Aston Martin looks set to become the best of the rest this season, behind usual title contenders Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes.

2023 season set for more controversies

The 2023 season is set to be the biggest yet, but it has got off to a rocky start after drivers complained about new rules introduced by governing body the FIA, restricting them from making ""political, religious and personal statements"" unless previously approved in writing.

The FIA has since responded by clarifying that drivers will be able to ""express their views on any political, religious or personal matter"" outside of races, but during races and on the track, any displays must be pre-approved by the governing body or the drivers will face sanctions.

The 2023 season is also set to be the busiest on record, with 23 races over nine months -- a decision that some drivers have opposed.

Current back-to-back champion Max Verstappen expressed his discontent with the calendar, previously telling CNN Sport: ""The problem is that we are traveling so much and it's getting more and more ... Basically, the question is, is it worth it to spend so much time away from family and friends by chasing more success?""

Alonso is hoping to compete with the top table of F1.

When asked if drivers have enough say in the future of the sport, Alonso thinks ""probably not.""

""But this is maybe not our role on this sport,"" he added. ""We drive these cars in on Sunday afternoons, but we cannot forget that this is a team sport.

""I think we have the right people leading the sport. We are in good hands with Liberty [Media], with Stefano Domenicali, with the FIA as well. I think we should put trust in our leaders.""

While Alonso admits that it will be ""challenging,"" he strikes a far more positive tone than many of his fellow drivers.

""I think it's going to be demanding on teams, mechanics, media, all of us,"" he said. ""But we love what we do. We have a dream job. We enjoy every second of it.""

Alonso unquestionably loves what he does. Last season, he overtook Kimi Räikkönen to become the first driver in F1 history to start 350 races, and doesn't look like stopping anytime soon.

He is coy on Aston Martin's chances of challenging this season, saying that a podium finish is not a ""realistic target at the moment,"" but if the pre-season omens are anything to go by, that target could rapidly become more reality than fantasy.

Two decades on from his first race win, Alonso looks like he might just be a contender once again.","['Amanda Davies', 'Alasdair Howorth']",2023-03-02
193,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/24/sport/boxing-olympics-chaos-iba-usa-spt-intl,Infighting in the sport and Russia's invasion of Ukraine leaves Olympic boxing on the ropes,"(CNN) It's an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible ""sabotage,"" saying the IBA had announced a ""false and misleading"" qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women's and men's world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

Andy Cruz of Team Cuba dodges a punch from Keyshawn Davis of Team USA during the men's lightweight final at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA's running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the ""ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.""

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to ""come together and work together as a unit"" so it can ""continue to fight for our Olympic future.""

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be ""fundamental change"" before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body's decision was ""taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.""

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA's ""financial dependency"" on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the ""continuing and very concerning issues"" over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been ""dealing with significant governance issues,"" which it said were a ""burden from the past leadership.""

""We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC's upper echelon,"" the statement added.

""This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.""

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women's and men's world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be ""main qualification events"" for Paris 2024.

The IBA's announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation's banners -- or competing in general -- in many sports following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin's troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as ""neutral athletes.""

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other ""like-minded"" countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries -- including the UK, Canada and most of Europe -- said in a joint statement that there is ""no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.""

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the ""Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.""

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to ""use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.""

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA's announcement, saying ""the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024's boxing qualifications and tournament.""

The statement said the IBA's suspension was ""still in force"" and that ""the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.""

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA's announcement of qualifying tournaments ""totally unacceptable"" and said it ""clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.""

""IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,"" he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained ""committed to the Olympic movement"" by following the IOC's principles of ""proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.""

On Wednesday, Ukraine's boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA's world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men's and women's championships.

""Our answer is clear -- our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,"" Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

If the PGA Tour's revamped 2024 schedule succeeds in pitting the golf's major stars against one another more regularly, the sport's latest rivalries could be about to get more showings.

The new schedule offers increased prize purses, smaller fields, and no cuts, much like the breakaway LIV Golf Series

""It is more opportunity for the top players to battle it out late on Sundays,"" world No. 8 Max Homa told reporters.

""Which, you look back at times of Phil and Tiger, the two best players growing up for me watching, and they had like maybe two real battles. So we're going to have more of that.""

World No. 3 Rory McIlroy is another supporter of the revamp, describing as it as ""trying to get the top guys vs. the hot guys.""

Unveiled by PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan in a letter to the Tour's membership, the new schedule will include eight ""designated events"" made up of between 70 and 78 players.

Eligibility criteria, as well as which events are to be marked as ""designated,"" are set to be specified at a later date, a press release from the Tour said.

However, it added that the ""framework"" for eligibility will ""reward top performers"" on the Tour -- including the top 50 players from the previous year's FedEx Cup rankings, the top-30 PGA Tour players in the world rankings, and tournament winners during the season.

And with no 36-hole cut line, all golfers competing will play the entirety of the events that offer elevated purses, as well as FedEx Cup points.

Though involvement will not be mandatory, these two factors, as well as the competitiveness and ""prestige"" of the tournaments, will ""incentivize"" participation, the Tour added.

""These smaller, Designated event fields will not only deliver substantial, can't-miss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season, but they will also enhance the quality of Full-Field events,"" Monahan said in the letter to players.

""Together, this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive, compelling, consequential and with clarity for fans, players and sponsors alike.""

The new scheduling will not affect the majors, The Players Championship, as well as three FedEx Cup Playoff events. Their existing format is set to remain unchanged, with designated events run in addition.

'Imitation is the greatest form of flattery'

Designated events were first announced by the PGA Tour last August, with 12 on the 2023 schedule. The first on this season's calendar was the Phoenix Open in February, as Scottie Scheffler secured $3.6 million in prize money.

Though still including a cut line, the increased purses at these tournaments were offered as a response to the emergence of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Series last year.

Bankrolled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), LIV Golf offered huge amounts of money for players to leave the established tours -- the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour -- to join the new series.

PIF pledged to award $250 million in total prize money for the tour's inaugural season. Of the $25 million prizes purses offered at each of the first seven events, $20 million was a guaranteed split between players. Played across three rounds as opposed to the typical four, golfers could not be cut as part of a team-based format.

""Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Congratulations PGA Tour. Welcome to the future,"" read a tweet from LIV Golf's official account Wednesday.

The inaugural LIV Golf event was hosted at Centurion Club in St Albans, England in June 2022.

Ahead of the PGA Tour's Arnold Palmer Invitational this week, a host of its big-name golfers were quizzed on their views about the revamped schedule.

Consistently outspoken against LIV Golf, accusing it of ""ripping apart"" men's professional golf, McIlroy has previously been dubbed the de-facto spokesperson for the PGA Tour.

Asked whether the new schedule's restricted eligibility criteria could leave lower-ranked golfers ""on the outside looking in,"" the four-time major champion said he was firmly behind the new plans.

""I love it,"" McIlroy told reporters Wednesday. ""Obviously I've been a part of it and been in a ton of discussions. I think it makes the TOUR more competitive.

""I'm all about rewarding good play. I want to give everyone a fair shake at this. Which I think this structure has done. There's ways to play into it.

When Scheffler was asked whether designated events were threatening to create a ""closed shop,"" the world No. 2 said: ""I think it's exciting because you're going to have the top guys in the world playing against each other more often.

""You're going to be able to guarantee the sponsors that those guys are going to be there four days. I think that's a lot of value added to TV and for sponsors.

""I think it's a better model overall for the Tour to have a set of events that are aspirational and that give guys access to those events.

""If you earn your way in to those events, the top 50 in the FedExCup this year gets into all of 'em ... I think it's more of a reward for the guys that are playing the best on the Tour.""

McIlroy discussed his thoughts on the new schedule on Wednesday.

Scheffler: Money not a factor

Discussing the increased spotlight on prize purses, Scheffler insisted that money was not a ""motivating factor"" for players on the PGA Tour.

""We get paid a ridiculous amount of money to do what we do out here, but I don't think money is the motivating factor for too many guys,"" Scheffler said.

""You can't really base life decisions when it comes to money. When you're out here playing golf tournaments you're never thinking about the money, you just want to win the tournament.

""So as being kind of a golf purist, that's the motivation. I want to be able to play well, win tournaments and get the most out of my game.""

In response to the absence of a cut line at designated events, McIlroy highlighted the absence of cuts at various existing PGA Tour events -- including the CJ Cup and the Zozo Championship -- as proof there is a ""precedent"" for the format.

""The only reason no-cut events are a big deal is because LIV has come along ... There's been no-cut events since I've been a member of the TOUR and way beyond that as well,"" McIlroy said.

""It keeps the stars there for four days. You ask Mastercard or whoever it is to pay 20 million dollars for a golf event, they want to see the stars at the weekend. They want a guarantee that the stars are there. So if that's what needs to happen, then that's what happens.""

Homa's 'rant'

Perhaps the most impassioned defense of the new scheduling however, came from Homa, who warned he could ""rant on this for awhile"" regarding the changes as the 32-year-old American delivered a four four-minute monologue.

While he understood ""gripes"" around the limited fields, Homa said that discussions with Monahan had confirmed his belief that the plans were positive for the game.

""I think it's easy to frame these changes as a way to put more money in the top players' pockets, but it has been made to make it easier and more fun for the fans,"" said Homa.

Addressing concerns over restricted fields, Homa highlighted the example of an unnamed golfer who had become a ""running joke"" due to his participation in a PGA Tour event. According to Homa, the player was a professional golfer but was no longer a practicing pro.

""Those people will be in a ton of the events,"" he said.

Homa in action during the pro-am prior to the Arnold Palmer Invitational.

""Now the sponsors have to say, 'Well do we want ... a chunk of the field [being] guys that won an event years and years ago that have jobs or have retired well before that,"" added Homa.

""It is a major in a way or a major field every single week.

""So I think it will be a new and improved challenge. I think it's important that we all test each other against one another each week. If you don't, you will get pushed aside and have to work your way back up.

""It will be a different kind of stress that we haven't had before, but I do think it will be stressful.""

Asked if he wanted a break before continuing with the rest of his press conference, Homa declined, quipping: ""Sorry guys. I think a lot and you just heard my brain spill out.""",['Jack Bantock'],2023-03-02

Now, Palestinian national team wants a slice of the action at 2026 tournament","(CNN) The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory's presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting ""free Palestine,"" while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel's creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel's capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel's creation -- in what Palestinians call the ""Nakba"" and Israelis call Independence Day -- clashes have been frequent.

Rami Hamadeh plays for the Palestianian national team against Jordan at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, AFC Asian Cup.

""Nakba"" means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

""The Israeli occupation doesn't just affect me, but affects ... Palestinian sports in general,"" the Palestinian team's goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

""Whether it's players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.""

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian football player Mahmoud Sarsak, who staged a hunger strike of nearly three months while in Israeli jail, is surrounded by relatives and supporters at the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on July 10, 2012 upon his release from prison.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel's ""illegal combatant"" policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said ""I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.""

But last year's AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

""The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It's the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,"" the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes' movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was ""clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.""

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

Makram Daboub (C) became the Palestinian national team's official coach in 2021.

The politics of travel

Nicknamed the ""Lions of Canaan"" and the ""Fedayeen,"" the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

""Our training base is in the West Bank, and I'm able to watch the matches here. But I can't watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can't come to the West Bank either,"" said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

""Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,"" Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, ""Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.""

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team's official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

""We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,"" said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer's world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won't be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

Morocco's Ismail El Haddad and Palestinian Yaser Hamed contest the ball in an Arab Cup game in December 2021.

""I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,"" said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

'Love of football'

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup -- the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages -- Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

""When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it's from the Palestinian bloodline,"" Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain's national football team if he's called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

""I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I'm proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It's like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,"" said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

The president of the Palestinian FA Jibril Rajoub holding a press conference with IOC President Thomas Bach (not seen) after their meeting in Ramallah, West Bank, on September 19, 2022.

The PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad's first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players' health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

""To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,"" said Shaheen.

""The nutritional support that's added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,"" Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been ""shining"" in the Portuguese league.

Oday Dabbagh, who plays club football in Portugal, is pictured playing for the Palestinian national team against Song Kum Song of North Korea during the 2018 AFC Under-23 Championship in Jiangyin city, east China's Jiangsu province, in January 2018.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA -- he plays for Portugal's F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team's future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn't always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel's control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association's (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn't violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its ""FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.""

Additionally, FIFA's football infrastructure projects ""include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,"" according to FIFA.

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, back right, and President of the Palestine Olympic Committee Jibril Rajoub, second right, back, meet with young Palestinian athletes at Faisal Al-Husseini stadium in the West Bank city of Al-Ram, north of Jerusalem, in September 2022.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces ""won't stop us from our plans.""

""This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,"" said Hilal.

""There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it's known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,"" Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn't hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.

While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.

""There's a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,"" said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

""For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,""

Coach Daboub goes even further.

If so, think again.

In a survey published by the NFL Players' Association (NFLPA) on Wednesday, 1,300 players provided feedback on the league's 32 teams, which were then ranked in a variety of categories.

Look away now if you're a fan of the Los Angeles Chargers, the Arizona Cardinals or the Washington Commanders.

NFL players rated teams in the NFLPA's ""Club Report Cards"" survey based on their treatment of families, nutrition, weight room, strength and conditioning staff, training room, training staff and locker room. They also provided feedback specific to each team.

The Minnesota Vikings were ranked as the best overall: the NFLPA report pointing to the franchise's newly built, state-of-the-art facility, calling the team a ""shining example of what is possible when a concerted investment is made in both staffing and facilities.""

The Miami Dolphins came second, with the only critique being that players would ""like a better post-game family area with more accessibility for players' families."" The Las Vegas Raiders finished third.

At the other end of the scale, the Chargers, Cardinals and Commanders comprised the bottom three.

The Commanders finished last, with the franchise handed an F-minus for their training room, locker room and team travel, while also getting an F for treatment of families.

Complaints from players included an understaffed training room, undersized hot and cold tubs for player recovery, not enough personal space in the locker room and lack of warm water and issues with poor drainage in the showers.

The Chargers and Cardinals didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

In a statement sent to CNN, the Commanders said: ""Player health and safety is our top priority, and we continue to invest in our facilities, including a new practice field, new turf in the practice bubble and increased meeting room space. We know there is more to do, and we regularly talk with our players about ways to improve their work environment and the experience for their families.""

The Washington Commanders celebrate after Milo Eifler completes a play during the first half of the game against the Dallas Cowboys at FedExField on January 8, 2023.

Over one-fifth of players surveyed -- 22% -- also felt they didn't have enough space on team flights, with the Commanders one of seven teams in the NFL that apparently don't offer their players first-class seats.

The Cardinals ranked last in terms of food, with players complaining that they were charged for food at the facility, reportedly the only team to do so.

The team was also criticized heavily for the low standard of its facilities, with some complaining the weight room feels like a ""safety hazard.""

Players labeled the Chargers' hot and cold tubs ""gross.""

Meanwhile, the Jacksonville Jaguars appear to have a bit of a rodent problem.

""When asked what the number one thing they want changed at their facility, the answer was unanimous -- get rid of the rats! Players reported that for 3-4 weeks this season, there was a rat infestation in the locker room and laundry hampers,"" the report said.

The Jaguars didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

The Cincinnati Bengals are one of three teams that do not provide dinner to their players and are the only team that doesn't provide supplements. They are also the only team that does not have outlets in their lockers to charge devices.

The rankings aren't necessarily an indication of success on the field though, with the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs coming in at 29th.

The objective of the ""Club Report Cards"" was to help provide ""players with information about each club to not only help them make important career decisions, but also try and raise standards across each club,"" according to NFLPA president JC Tretter.

""One of our core jobs as a union is to improve the overall working conditions for our players,"" added Tretter.

""Often, you see our advocacy on 'big' issues -- like our push for better field surfaces at stadiums or standardized safety protocols that limit the risk of workplace injuries -- but it also includes the daily experience of players at the team facilities away from the lights and cameras,"" he said.",['Ben Morse'],2023-03-03

202,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/football/super-league-documentary-football-jeff-zimbalist-spt-intl,A 'political thriller' filled with personal betrayals. The inside story of the Super League and the war for soccer's soul,"(CNN) Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming -- just ask Julius Caesar, who asked ""Et tu Brute?"" as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition -- the Champions League -- are akin to a 'House of Cards' plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe's biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body's UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams -- the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary ""Super League: The War for Football,"" the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a ""political thriller ... 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,"" its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles -- or its future -- and, most stingingly of all, ""betrayal"" between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter's godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was ""sort of the general of the opposing army,"" Zimbalist says.

""The dynamics at play here aren't that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,"" he adds. ""The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.""

Aleksander Čeferin was elected UEFA President in 2016.

Characters -- normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews -- are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother's death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez's about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi's about his tennis playing days.

""This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,"" Zimbalist says. ""These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

""We were watching what's usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.""

'Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?'

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs -- all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to ""drop a legislative bomb"" to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

Andrea Agnelli was replaced by Nasser Al-Khelaifi as the chairman of the European Club Association.

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects' reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

""That was how we presented it to them,"" Zimbalist says.

""We're going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they're rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.""

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

""You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,"" he says. ""But then you're leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.""

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport's most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football's magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

Real Madrid won the 2022 Champions League.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

""This identity crisis in the sport -- is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?"" Zimbalist says. ""If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn't fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.""

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the ""cynical project,"" as seemingly, did football's world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA's more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

'The war for football rages on'

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with ""60 to 80 teams"" earlier this month.

Zimbalist's documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by ""old money"" clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by ""new money"" club such as PSG and Manchester City.

""We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,"" he says.

""And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?""

Giorgio Marchetti is the Deputy General Secretary of UEFA.

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team's representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors -- including Agnelli -- resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor's office in Turin.

Barcelona's already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become ""a reality in 2025.""

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN's Richard Quest last month that for them, ""the Super League is in the past.""

""It was something that we apologized for and ... going forward, it's not something that we're interested in.""

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league's fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the ""ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,"" Zimbalist says.

""Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.""",['Issy Ronald'],2023-02-27

206,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/07/sport/conor-benn-doping-analysis-reaction-spt-intl,Conor Benn has 'serious concerns' over boxing's drug testing after being cleared of failed test because of 'highly-elevated consumption of eggs',"(CNN) Conor Benn's scheduled fight with Chris Eubank Jr. last year was meant to be career defining for both men.

Except the fight never took place and now Benn says the fallout of its cancellation has raised serious questions about boxing's drugs testing protocols.

The two were scheduled to take to their ring almost exactly 30 years after their fathers had in two fights that gripped a generation of boxing fans. Benn and Eubank Jr. were fighting for more than just glory. This was a fight for family honor.

But on the eve of the bout, news of Benn failing a drugs test came to light. The bout was called off after Benn tested positive for clomiphene, a fertility drug used by women who struggle to ovulate.

Benn repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and in February 2023, the World Boxing Council (WBC) issued a statement clearing Benn of wrongdoing, stating that while his urine test indicated the presence of prohibited substances, his ""highly-elevated consumption of eggs"" prior to testing offered a ""reasonable explanation"" for his failed test.

Despite welcoming the news that he could return to the sport, the 26-year-old Benn has criticized the investigation and expressed his concerns about the transparency of the process, in particular leveling criticism at the WBC and the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC), the governing body for professional boxing in Great Britain.

In a statement posted on his Instagram story last week, Benn said that ""the manner in which I've been cleared has seemed to create further questions and add further fuel to baseless negative speculation.""

CNN has contacted the WBC and BBBofC for comment.

Cancellation

According to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), clomiphene in men can potentially boost testosterone levels ""by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis."" The drug is also included on the World Anti-Doping Agency's prohibited list under anti-estrogenic substances.

Benn began his statement on Instagram addressing the ruling saying that while he was ""grateful for the ultimate finding"" of being declared ""innocent of being a drugs cheat,"" he couldn't sit by without commenting on the whole investigation.

""It was the right decision and it was the only one I was willing to accept. The easy option would have been to accept a six month ban, save myself a huge legal bill and simply move on, by my reputation and my family name is worth more to me than that,"" he wrote.

""At no point did I indicate that I failed any VADA tests because of contaminated eggs,"" Benn wrote, referring to the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA), a third-party testing agency used by the fighters to ensure a clean bout and which carried out his test.

""As part of its lengthy investigation, the WBC instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet, and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause,"" he wrote, saying he provided a 270-page report to the body.

Benn added: ""However, I feel like the WBC statement did a disservice to my defence, which was based upon a comprehensive scientific review of the testing procedures which set out a number of reasons why we believed the results were completely unreliable and proved beyond any reasonable doubt that I am innocent.""

Benn is still under investigation from UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) and the BBCofC at the time of publication.

He criticized the BBCofC's handling of his case in his statement.

""As for the BBBoC, they attacked me publicly and privately during the most difficult time in my life, treating me with utter contempt and without any consideration for the fair process or my mental state.""

The BBCofC released their own statement on Twitter after the announcement from the WBC in February, saying that it was not ""party to the review"" and had not seen ""any evidence provided on Mr. Benn's behalf.""

It added that while ""it respects the WBC, the WBC is a sanctioning body and not a governing body. The BBCofC was the governing body with whom Mr. Benn was licensed at the material time, and as such any alleged anti-doping violation shall be dealt with in accordance with its rules and regulations.""

It pointed to the UK Anti-Doping Rules, brought in by UKAD, which the BBCofC adheres to and that as a result, ""the decision of the WBC does not affect the ongoing implantation of the BBCofC's rules (and those of UKAD).""

CNN has contacted the BBCofC for comment. UKAD declined to comment when given the opportunity.

'Serious concerns'

The WBC's February ruling stated that they had found there to be ""no failures in the procedures"" in relation to Benn's sample and test.

But Benn said he thought there was a lack of transparency throughout the whole investigation, claiming that his sample tested negative three times, but ""without explanation"" was tested nine days later which resulted in the positive test.

According to Benn, he asked for his B sample from the drug test -- which the World Anti-Doping Agency says ""affords the athlete the opportunity to have second analysis performed in the event their A sample returns"" a positive test -- to be tested as soon as possible.

Benn also said in his statement that he has been advised to take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Benn said that he had never previously tested positive for a banned substance before October's test, adding to his belief that the result was a ""testing error.""

While Benn now says that he had to concentrate on ""rebuilding"" his career, the process he has gone through has given him ""serious concerns about the whole testing system"" in boxing.

""Anti-doping protections are obviously extremely important, but so is ensuring people are given due proves and presumed innocent until proven guilty. Cheaters should be caught and punished, but people like me who prove their innocent should be vindicated and allowed to continue their career.""

Benn admitted that he'd had suicidal thoughts as a result of the whole process, saying: ""I didn't think I'd see another day.""

""It's hurt me,"" Benn said in an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. ""I didn't think I was going to make it through this period. I didn't think I was going to make it through.""

When asked if he had felt suicidal, Benn replied: ""Yeah. Yeah, I'd say so -- and it upsets me now because I don't know how I got so bad. I got in a really bad way about it.

""I was shamed for something I hadn't even done. ... If I had done something wrong, I'm human. I'd raise my hands to it, 'I made a mistake,' whatever it is, I raise my hands. Never this.

""I felt seven years of hard work and sacrifice, and leaving my family and the image I maintain, was just ruined by somebody else's incompetence. It's been hard for the family.""

Background

At the time of Benn's positive test last year, the bout's promoter, Matchroom, and that organization's boss, Eddie Hearn, had been keen for the bout to go ahead despite it being ""prohibited"" by the BBBofC.

Hearn told the BBC at the time: ""As we stand right now, the BBBofC is not sanctioning the fight. That does not mean the fight is off, but there is a process we have to go through.

""Conor Benn is not suspended, he is free and clear to fight. There's lots going on with the lawyers.""

Eddie Hearn, boxing promoter of Matchroom boxing, speaks at the press conference ahead of Benn's scheduled fight with Eubank Jr.

Amid mounting public pressure and safety concerns, the fight was canceled.

The decision to overlook potential safety concerns and stage a bout including a fighter who had tested positive for a banned substance prompted criticism that boxing prioritizes the fight's money-making opportunities rather than the boxers' safety.

Weeks later, the BBBofC claimed that Benn voluntarily relinquished his license with the governing body just before allegations of misconduct against Benn were upheld.

Benn accused the BBBofC of conducting an ""unfair and biased procedure."" He also disputes that he relinquished his license.

""(Benn) strongly refutes the allegation of misconduct (which for the avoidance of doubt is not in relation to the Vada issue) and firmly believes that an independent tribunal will reach a wholly different conclusion,"" a statement said on Benn's Twitter at the time.

And a few months later, the WBC announced after it had conducted an investigation into the matter that Benn would be included in its ratings once again after it found that he had not ""engaged in intentional or knowing ingestion of clomiphene.""",['Ben Morse'],2023-03-07

208,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/golf/chris-kirk-alcoholism-depression-honda-classic-spt-intl,Chris Kirk battled alcoholism and depression -- now he has secured his first PGA Tour victory in seven years,"(CNN) It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour. Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday, that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind.

A nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American's fifth PGA Tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.

""I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety,"" Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort.

""I wouldn't be doing this for a living anymore. I probably wouldn't have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.

""For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.

""It's something that's constantly on my mind, so it's pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.""

Kirk during the final round.

'I got sober because of you'

On the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019, Kirk announced he would be taking an ""indefinite leave"" from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.

""I thought I could control it, but after multiple relapses, I have come to realize I can't fix this on my own,"" Kirk added in a social media post.

By that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.

A tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk's sole top-40 finish of the campaign.

When he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further -- he was world No. 303 -- but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.

candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer's previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.

Kirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to ""accelerate"" his alcohol issues.

For Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.

Kirk is congratulated by his caddie after victory.

""It's been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, 'I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],"" Kirk said.

""When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more ... for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.

""So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.

""But now on the back end a little bit, it's been amazing. Like I said, it's not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and ... for somebody to say, 'I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,' you can't really describe how unreal that is with words.""

Augusta calling

On Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.

The American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot -- ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event -- who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.

For both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.

Again, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.

When Cole's birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip's hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.

As well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday's triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.

""I've been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that's going to be something that's incredibly special,"" Kirk said.

""That par-3 contest can't come soon enough. I'm really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.""

On Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.

""It'll be a lot of celebrating, and I thank God that alcohol won't be a part of it,"" Kirk said.",['Jack Bantock'],2023-02-27

210,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/06/football/world-cup-final-penalty-shootout-spt-intl,World Cup final: How Argentina won penalty shootout,"(CNN) A soccer match lasts for 90 minutes, another 30 if there really needs to be a winner. But if it's still level after that, then the game will be decided with a penalty shootout , arguably the most nerve-shredding experience in all of sports.

For the fans, it's excruciating; at the World Cup in Qatar , one Argentina supporter sobbed uncontrollably as she watched the quarterfinal shootout against the Netherlands through her fingers. By the end, she looked distraught. All the emotion had been wrung out of her, and the tears that she cried were of relief, rather than joy.

For the players, such emotions are magnified tenfold. ""Love hurts,"" goes the anonymous quote, ""but not as much as penalties.""

Success or failure could be career-defining, one simple kick from 12 yards is weighed down by teammates' hopes and the expectation of potentially millions of fans. As the author Karl Wiggins put it, ""It's as if, for a few seconds, a player's soul is laid bare for the entire world to see.""

Very few people would admit to enjoying a shootout, but Professor Geir Jordet is an exception; he can't get enough of them.

""A penalty shootout is a very uncomfortable event,"" he told CNN Sport from his research facility in Oslo. ""It's painful because the pressure is so intense, and of course, the consequences of failing are so dire. Penalties, for me, are wonderful!""

Professor Jordet works at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, where he specializes in performance under extreme pressure. He's been studying shootouts for almost 20 years and has analyzed more than 200 of them, around 2,000 kicks in total.

He's studied the psychology of the event, observed the behavior and dynamics of the participants and crunched the data to conclude that even the most dramatic of shootouts can be swayed by teams who know what they're doing.

""The main factor in a penalty shootout is luck,"" the former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton once declared, but Jordet is convinced that it is never ""only a lottery.""

Penalties are more important than ever

The margin between success and failure in title matches seems to be getting slimmer, and so it's in shootouts, where the margins are even tighter, that soccer's biggest prizes are being decided.

""If you enter a major tournament today with the ambition to win,"" says Jordet, ""you're making a severe mistake if you're not prepared for penalties.""

In 2021, both the Brazilian men and the Canadian women needed penalty wins en route to Olympic gold in Tokyo; in the same month, Argentina survived a shootout to win the Copa América and Italy triumphed in the same way at the European Championship at Wembley.

Mohamed Salah had to endure laser pointers in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations final penalty shootout.

The following year was a bonanza for penalties.

Starting in February with Senegal's Africa Cup of Nations final win against Egypt. Liverpool won two English cup finals -- both against Chelsea -- on spot-kicks, while Real Betis and RB Leipzig won the Spanish and German Cup finals respectively from the spot.

Eintracht Frankfurt beat Rangers in the Europa League final on penalties while the Philadelphia Union missed all of its kicks to hand LAFC the title after an extraordinary MLS Cup Final.

The 2022 penalty party concluded in Qatar where there was a record five shootouts, including the final.

Within seconds of the final whistle being blown, Jordet can tell if one side has the edge. He's able to glean valuable information simply by observing the interactions on the field.

""The coach and the staff of some teams almost panic when the game goes to penalties,"" Jordet explained to CNN Sport. ""It seems like they don't know what to do. And then with other teams, it's all dealt with before the game and definitely before the penalties.""

Jurgen Klopp won plaudits for the way he managed two penalty shootout victories for Liverpool in the League and FA Cup finals.

Last season's FA Cup final was a case in point; Jordet observed that Liverpool's manager Jurgen Klopp had established a plan and communicated it calmly and warmly to each of his players within 90 seconds of the final whistle.

They spent the remaining time casually interacting and even laughing. Several more minutes had passed before Chelsea's seemingly fraught manager Thomas Tuchel approached his players, and he was still revising his notes.

""He moves to the middle of the circle, BEFORE he's done with the plan,"" Jordet observed in a tweet thread, ""Tuchel then asks his players about the shots, publicly in front of the whole team.

""There's plenty of group pressure when done this way, the chance of honest responses from the players drops, and it creates further stress that carries on to the shootout itself.""

Liverpool's efficient organization meant the players were able to take up a position within the center circle that was closest to their coaching staff, where Klopp continued to exude warmth and love.

Chelsea went on to miss two penalties and Liverpool claimed the trophy.

World Cup Final penalty masterclass

Nobody can influence the proceedings in a shootout more than the goalkeeper, who is involved in every single kick. Jordet's research has confirmed that the goalies aren't just there to stop the shots, they can be a positive influence on their teammates and a destructive force for their opponents.

In recent seasons, Argentina's 30-year-old goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez has established himself as a gamechanger in shootouts, the ""Machiavelli of football.""

Jordet has noticed that his psychological antics are a nightmare for his opponents. During the semifinal of the Copa América against Colombia in 2021, he intimidated his opponents with trash talk, saving three penalties in a 3-2 win.

Since the stadiums were empty of fans in that edition, Jordet has noted that you could clearly hear what he was saying, ""I can tell you're nervous. I know where you're going to shoot. Watch and see how I'm going to eat you up. Remember, I'm going to eat you up!""

But it was in the World Cup final against France that Martínez demonstrated the full range of his expertise.

Jordet says that he set the tone right from the start, arriving first in the penalty area and claiming the territory as his own. ""Martínez took a very proactive approach to everything,"" Jordet explained.

""He created his home in the penalty area. He initiated some handshakes with the first French players to arrive,"" a disarming strategy which makes opponents drop their guard and renders them more vulnerable when he later strikes.

Argentina fans played their part by pilling pressure on the French penalty takers.

For the first two French penalties, Martínez discreetly set about disrupting the takers, urging the referee to check the placement of the ball on the spot.

This kind of interference would be unsettling for any penalty takers, but he was also feeling out the referee: how much would he be prepared to tolerate?

Jordet believes that enabled Martínez to quickly assume a proactive role within just two kicks and was then able to ""fully get to work.""

Martínez saved the second penalty that he faced, diving low to his right to deny Kingsley Coman, and his celebration was exuberant.

Jordet notes that goalkeepers don't typically celebrate so wildly, but his research has shown that celebrations can influence subsequent events.

""We found, to our astonishment, that penalty takers who celebrate intensely have a statistically higher probability of ending up on the winning team.

""In fact, the next penalty taker for the opponent misses about 10-15% of the time, and your next [teammate] scores about 7 to 8% more of their penalties. These types of celebratory displays are contagious.""

By the time the third French player stepped up, Martínez knew that he could get away with almost anything. He snatched up the ball, turned his back on the referee and walked back to his goal line.

The approaching Aurélien Tchouaméni should have arrived at the biggest moment of his professional career to find the ball on the spot, instead Martínez was holding it, gesturing to the Argentine fans to increase the volume.

France fans show their support for les bleus during the World Cup final.

When the referee demanded its return, Martínez rolled it away at a 45-degree angle, forcing Tchouaméni to fetch it himself. Jordet has calculated that whenever a player has to wait for a kick, the probability of a goal drops by 20 to 30%.

Tchouaméni aimed low and to the left and missed.

By now, Martínez knew that his own teammates could face similar tactics from the French goalie Hugo Lloris, so he grabbed the ball himself and handed it to his incoming teammate Leandro Paredes, one of four Argentine penalty takers, who all scored.

Martínez was eventually booked for interfering with the fourth French player, Randal Kolo Muani, but by then the damage was done and Argentina won the shootout 4-2.

""Very calculated, creative, well executed,"" Jordet concludes, ""but of course also highly, highly cynical.""

Emiliano Martínez of Argentina attempted to distract Randal Kolo Muani ahead of his penalty.

Martínez showed very little remorse for his ""cynical"" actions. After the final he said, """"I have no words for it. I was calm during the penalty shootout and everything went as we wanted.""

""All that I have dreamed of has been achieved.""

Since the conclusion of the World Cup, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which determines the laws of football, confirmed to CNN Sport that it is looking to clarify what goalkeepers can and cannot do before penalties are taken.

This would include delaying the taking of the kick or touching the goalposts, crossbar or goal net.

Shootouts don't always have to be so negative, though; sometimes, they can be won with love.

Jordet notes that when LAFC's Cristian Tello missed the first penalty against Philadelphia in the MLS Cup Final, some of his teammates met him on his return to the center circle and walked him back in.

""You're implicitly saying to the others that even if you miss, you're a part of the group, which is the message that you would like to send to each other in a penalty shootout.""

Los Angeles made every other kick to claim the cup.

The power of intangibles

Some teams seem to revel in the cauldron of the shootout, while others dread it.

England has lost seven of the 10 that it's participated in, while the Netherlands have lost seven out of eight. Spain's loss to Morocco in 2022 means it's now lost a record four shootouts in the FIFA World Cup alone.

Jordet has seen enough to believe in ghosts; he says that if your team has lost in a previous shootout, even if you weren't involved in it, you're more likely to miss. Conversely, success begets success.

Having lost to Czechoslovakia and the famous Antonin Panenka penalty i n the European Championship final in 1976, Germany has won six in a row, Croatia has won its last four, and Argentina its last three, claiming both the Copa América and the World Cup.

More and more teams are coming to accept that understanding the psychology of shootouts is essential in the modern game, and 20 professional teams have already turned to Jordet's consultancy business for help.

""I totally think there's so much more to be discovered in the softer areas of sports science,"" Jordet says, dismissing the cynics who claim that skill development, relationships and psychology are important, but not quantifiable.

""I honestly would beg to differ. If you know what to look for, you can measure a lot of these things in games, and this is something I work on every single day. I think we will make some big progress in the years to come.""

The Moroccan team gathered together for a prayer before going on to beat Spain in their penalty shootout.

Jordet knows so much about penalties because he spent years trawling the archives, watching every single shootout from the World Cup, European Championship and Copa América since 1976. He's interviewed 25 players who were there and tested his predictions in practice with 15 elite teams.

""I love penalty shootouts,"" he says, ""I think it's the ultimate drama in football.""

And yet, much of the nuance he described in the World Cup final wouldn't have been obvious to the fans watching the game on TV because broadcasters tend to fill the space between the kicks with replays and closeups of anxious coaches and fans.

""The details that really mattered, the subplot of the event, can only be accessed if you're lucky enough to have access to isolated broadcast cameras or by scrolling through fan videos on YouTube.

""TV producers aren't always my friends,"" Jordet concludes, ""because they don't look at what I like to look at.""

But now that teams are beginning to realize the value of small details in shootouts, perhaps broadcasters might also consider innovating their approach. The greatest drama in sport is happening right under their noses, and sometimes they're missing the best bits.",['Don Riddell'],2023-03-06
211,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/sport/damian-lillard-71-points-record-nba-spt-intl,Damian Lillard becomes first player in NBA history to score over 70 points in under 40 minutes,"(CNN) Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

""I enjoy those moments in the game when I'm just going after people,"" the NBA All-Star said after the game. ""That's all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.""

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell's 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting -- even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts -- just one off Klay Thompson's record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard's teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell's total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

""It really, really was a masterful performance,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star's game. ""It was a piece of art. That was incredible.""

Any postgame celebrations for Lillard were cut short after he was picked for a drug test.

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain's record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

""I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you're hot, you're in attack mode, you're feeling good,"" he said.

Not only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.

The Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.

The Trail Blazers stay on the west coast for their next game as they travel to the Bay Area to play the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night.",['Alasdair Howorth'],2023-02-27
