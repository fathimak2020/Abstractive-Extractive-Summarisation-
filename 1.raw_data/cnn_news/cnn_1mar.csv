The Los Angeles Lakers’ rollercoaster season shows no sign of slowing down.

During the Lakers’ 27-point comeback victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, TV cameras caught LeBron James saying he heard his foot “pop” when landing from a layup. The 38-year-old was seen walking gingerly after the game despite being able to finish the win.

Just as the Lakers seem to be building some momentum with a three-game winning streak, with their stars shining and the new additions playing their part, James looks set to be in for a spell on the sidelines.

Multiple reports say the 19-time All-Star could miss several weeks, but is awaiting further tests to determine the full extent of the injury.

James posted a photo of his injured foot to his Instagram story on Monday, after it was announced he would miss the match against the Memphis Grizzlies, along with the caption: “Fkn sucks!!!!”

Just another day in ‘Laker Land’ – and it couldn’t have come at a worse time.

With 21 games remaining and sitting two spots outside of a spot in the postseason’s play-in tournament – and six spots away from automatic qualification to the playoffs – the Lakers remain in danger of missing the playoffs for the second successive season. Or will we see those famous yellow and purple uniforms in the NBA’s business end of the season?

Steadily improving

For such a storied franchise and one which was crowned NBA champion just over two years ago, this season has been one full of questions and arguably not one coming up with the right answers.

Heading into the season, general manager Rob Pelinka had his work cut out to round out the team’s roster, even with superstars like James and Anthony Davis on the books – all with limited draft capital largely thanks to the widely criticized trade for Russell Westbrook.

The acquisition of Patrick Beverley in August filled a need but many pundits believed that the Lakers had not done enough to put themselves in contention to compete for a title.

Criticism from fans and pundits was even louder because of the finite amount of time it appears James has left at the top level as he approaches 40 and Pelinka’s inability to build a contender around arguably the NBA’s greatest player.

So the season began as many predicted, with the Lakers winning just two of their first 12 games. On November 12, the Lakers were 14th in the Western Conference.

To the credit of first-year head coach Darvin Ham and the team’s leading players, the Lakers dug themselves out of a hole, winning eight of their next 10 games.

But down to a combination of injuries, lack of consistency and a lopsided roster, the Lakers struggled to kick on and make a serious surge up the standings or show their championship mettle.

Midseason trades seemed to address some of the team’s issues of a lack of defense and shooting from the perimeter – Malik Beasley, D’Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt, Mo Bamba and Davon Reed arriving, while Westbrook was finally shipped out.

After Sunday’s win over the Mavericks, Dallas head coach Jason Kidd said Vanderbilt “kicked our a*s.”

Since the two trades on February 9, the team has gone 4-2 and seemingly turned its season on its head.

What are chances of the Lakers in the playoffs?

In any NBA season until 2020, the Lakers’ chances of competing in the playoffs would be seriously diminished with only eight teams qualifying.

But following the introduction of the play-in tournament during the bubble season in the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, a postseason berth is still within the team’s grasp.

The play-in tournament whittles down the teams ranked seventh to 10th in each conference to determine the final two spots in the playoffs. The seventh seeded team hosts the eighth, with the winner earning the No. 7 seed in the playoffs.

The ninth seeded team hosts the 10th ranked side, with the winner facing the loser of the game between the seventh and eighth seeds; the winner of this game will get the eighth and final spot in the playoff bracket.

It means that at the time of writing, the Lakers are currently on a three-game winning streak, have a record of 29-32 and sit 12th in the Western Conference; a game outside the play-in tournament. They are only two-and-a-half games outside of the sixth spot which would qualify them automatically for the playoffs.

According to the website Tankathon which measures the difficulty of a team’s remaining schedule for the rest of the season, the Lakers have the fifth hardest slate of games left.

It has been a far from perfect season for the Lakers so far, but it appears as if they might be coming into some form after the All-Star break.

Tied in the win column with a similarly imperfect Portland Trail Blazers, we could well be seeing the 17-time NBA champion duking it out in the play-in – James’ injury permitting.

Who knows, in a congested Western Conference, the Lakers could even reach the playoffs using the old-fashioned method."

It’s while running in the moors and hills of her native Scotland that Lesley Paterson sometimes sees her two careers become conveniently aligned.

A professional triathlete and screenwriter, Paterson has long inhabited two livelihoods that, on the surface, seem worlds apart. But in the quiet moments of a windswept run or a long bike ride, the occasional flash of inspiration can form the basis of her best ideas for film scripts.

She counts among those the opening scenes of the Oscar-nominated “All Quiet on the Western Front,” an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel of the same name published in 1929.

The film begins in the trenches of the First World War, where much of the action is situated, before we are soon transported to a provincial town in Germany. There, Paul Bäumer – a young army recruit and the story’s protagonist – notices how his new military uniform carries the name tag of another solider.

Unbeknownst to Bäumer, who is awkwardly told that the clothes were too small for their intended recipient, the soldier has apparently been killed in the war and his uniform recycled.

“It really sort of encapsulates the entire message of the film – that the uniform’s more important than the man,” Paterson tells CNN Sport.

“It’s just one of those moments where you know it’s good and you think: ‘Oh my God … where did this come from?’ You feel so lucky that you’ve thought of it.”

The scene, first visualized on a run in the Scottish Highlands, proved prescient. Last year, Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine complained of having to buy their own uniforms amid a shortage of basic equipment.

“If we can hold up a mirror to what’s going on to try and prevent more from happening, that truly is my goal as a storyteller – to effect change,” says Paterson.

First portrayed on screen in a much-loved Hollywood film nearly 100 years ago, “All Quiet” focuses on the tragedy and ruin of war, eschewing any notions of heroism or adventure.

Paterson, alongside writing partner Ian Stokell, got the option to the rights in 2006 but had to wait until 2020 before Netflix commissioned it as a German-language film.

The end product, which includes a new narrative strand focused on the Armistice Talks between German and French officials, captures the bloodshed and horror of the world’s first mechanized war in chilling detail.

It has been met with great critical acclaim, receiving nine Oscar nominations – including for best adapted screenplay – and a record-equaling 14 BAFTA nominations.

The BAFTA awards ceremony will be held on Sunday, while the Oscars take place on March 13 – two events that, for Paterson, will cap off years of hard work, stress and dogged resolve.

A five-time world champion across two formats of off-road triathlon, she relied on her sporting career as a source of income when it came to renewing the option contract each year, even to the extent that she forced herself to race through injury and acute pain.

That was in 2016, when Paterson fell off her bike and broke her shoulder the day before she was due to compete in Costa Rica. Partly devastated by the thought of not racing and partly overwhelmed by pain, she started to search for a solution.

With the help of her husband and her physio, she discovered she could still run and was able to ride her bike by propping her arm on the handlebars, leaving only the mile-long sea swim to consider.

“I do a lot of one-arm drills,” says Paterson. “I was always really good at it and I’ve got a very strong leg kick. I practiced in the ocean and I was like: ‘Well, I can do one arm, let’s give this a shot.’”

After finishing the swim some 15 minutes behind the rest of the field, Paterson made up ground on the 40-kilometer mountain bike section before taking the lead on the 10-kilometer run.

“I just kind of kept on going,” she says. “And then I ran off into the forest and it was just an exercise in perseverance and thinking outside the box. I had to get something done.”

The experience, itself worthy of a film script, was emblematic of the way Paterson approached triathlon throughout her life.

“I don’t know if that’s the sort of Scottish underdog mentality or if it’s just truly I’m driven by a joy and passion and not so worried about outcomes,” she says. “I’m a very sort of passionate, heart-driven athlete.”

Paterson has mostly competed on the XTERRA cross-triathlon series – “all off-road and muddy and gritty and out in nature,” she says – having previously missed out on qualifying for the Olympics with Great Britain at the start of her career.

After she moved to California in her twenties to further her film studies, competing in – and winning – races became a welcome financial boost, particularly as she looked to get “All Quiet” off the ground.

“Every year we had to weigh up the option payment was incredibly stressful because it’s a lot of money,” says Paterson.

“Me doing well at racing was a huge piece of that because you could get a lump sum of money that wasn’t necessarily expected. A big way that we funded the film was me racing and doing well. It was a massive motivation.”

Over the years, Paterson has seen her two careers become curiously intertwined. She has channeled the same energy and enthusiasm into both disciplines, driven, she says, by a love for what she’s doing and an obsessive attention to detail.

“I’ve always had these two simultaneous passions: the artist in me and the athlete in me,” says Paterson.

“People think they are often very separate, but they’re actually very, very similar in terms of the skills you build and utilize and how one can help the other. I’d say that I truly am the athlete I am because I’m an artist and the artist I am because I’m an athlete.”

Whether it’s sports or scriptwriting, Paterson says she has a habit of “looking for the biggest challenge and just kind of jumping in.”

It perhaps explains why she played rugby until the age of 12 – the only girl in a team of boys – and why she chose to tackle “All Quiet” at a time when war films were out of fashion in the industry.

The tide has slowly turned in her favor on that front, particularly with the release of Sam Mendes’ “1917” four years ago.

And with the landscape shifting towards foreign language cinema, director Edward Berger and producer Malte Grunert suggested pitching “All Quiet” in German, rather than English.

“There’s an authenticity – it’s their story, it’s their national novel, it’s rightly so that it’s in German,” says Paterson.

The popularity of “All Quiet” may take Paterson’s life in a different direction, especially now that she’s 42 and her racing career is almost over. She still coaches triathlon but expects to devote more time to film in the future.

Whatever she does next, Paterson will still be guided by the same simple philosophy.

“It’s focusing on the mastery of the craft and not focusing on the outcomes – that was a huge learning curve for me,” she says.

“As long as you have incredible passion and focus and stop thinking about where you want to be and being in the moment with where you’re at … That’s where the beauty comes.”"
2,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/sport/damian-lillard-71-points-record-nba-spt-intl,"CNN —

Damian Lillard set an NBA record in his monster scoring night on Sunday, racking up 71 points in 39 minutes, including 13 three-pointers, as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 121-114.

With his effort, Lillard became the first player in NBA history to score more than 70 points in under 40 minutes and just the eighth player to hit the 70-point mark.

He is also the only player on that elite list to score 70 over the age of 30, and the first to do so with 10 or more three-pointers.

“I enjoy those moments in the game when I’m just going after people,” the NBA All-Star said after the game. “That’s all it was tonight. I wanted to be in attack mode. I got it going and stayed aggressive.”

Lillard came into the game averaging 37.6 points in his previous 18 games and continued that stellar run with a league-wide, season-high mark, equaling Donovan Mitchell’s 71 points against the Chicago Bulls in January.

Lillard started the scoring early, with 41 points, including eight three-pointers at halftime. Whether driving into the paint or dropping shots from distance, the Blazers guard was unplayable.

He made all 14 of his free throw attempts and had a magnetic relationship with the basket when shooting – even sinking a ludicrous, 36-foot jumper in the second quarter.

He ended the game shooting 22-of-38 from the field, making 13 three-pointers from 22 attempts – just one off Klay Thompson’s record 14 3-pointers set in 2018.

Lillard’s teammates continued looking for him in the closing minutes to try and get ahead of Mitchell’s total, but after missing a couple of shots, he came off the court exhausted with 44 seconds left the clock.

“It really, really was a masterful performance,” Portland coach Chauncey Billups said of his star’s game. “It was a piece of art. That was incredible.”

With that performance, Lillard entered a pantheon of NBA greats. His 71-point haul is tied for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history, though still some way off Wilt Chamberlain’s record of 100 points set in 1962.

Lillard is behind only Chamberlain and Kobe Bryant for career 60-point games and he joins the two NBA legends as the only players to have separate games hitting 50, 60 and 70 points in a season according to CBS Sports.

“I think any hooper enjoys those moments when you’re hot, you’re in attack mode, you’re feeling good,” he said.

Not only was it a brilliant individual showing from Lillard, but it was also a much needed one.

The Blazers snapped a two-game losing skid with the win and keep their slim hopes of a playoff spot alive. Portland now sits in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 29-31 record but is only three games off the Phoenix Suns in fourth.

Betrayal has formed part of European politics since polities started forming – just ask Julius Caesar, who asked “Et tu Brute?” as his friend stabbed him for the good of the Roman Republic.

Fast forward to April 2021 and the machinations behind the proposed European Super League (ESL) that would have turned the sport on its head, effectively discarding its flagship competition – the Champions League – are akin to a ‘House of Cards’ plot.

Driven by 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs, the ESL intended to break away from European soccer governing body’s UEFA to create their own competition containing 20 teams – the founding members as well as three other permanent unnamed clubs and five others who would qualify every year.

In the Apple TV+ documentary “Super League: The War for Football,” the decisions that led to the controversial proposal are presented as a “political thriller … 96 sleepless hours over the course of four days,” its Emmy-award winning director Jeff Zimbalist tells CNN Sports.

Featuring almost all the key decision makers, the documentary depicts fans who felt betrayed by their clubs, soccer betraying its principles – or its future – and, most stingingly of all, “betrayal” between friends.

The friendship between UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin and Andrea Agnelli, then Juventus chairman and European Club Association chairman, forms the main narrative and emotional thread of the documentary.

Initially so close that Agnelli named Čeferin his daughter’s godfather as they worked together on reforming European football, their friendship unraveled as it became clear that Agnelli had helped formulate the rival ESL and was “sort of the general of the opposing army,” Zimbalist says.

“The dynamics at play here aren’t that different from the emotional and relational dynamics that we all have in our lives every day,” he adds. “The complexity of who to trust. And how deep the wound of betrayal runs.”

Characters – normally seen as names in a press release or faces giving television interviews – are fleshed out and offer tangible reasons for their actions, delving into their backstories.

Čeferin speaks about the moral dilemmas he faced as a lawyer defending traffickers and murderers; Agnelli about his brother’s death; Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez’s about his love of the club; and Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi’s about his tennis playing days.

“This is not a bunch of robotic, mechanical strategists sitting around a war room,” Zimbalist says. “These are human beings, flesh and blood, with three dimensions who are feeling all sorts of emotion during this time.

“We were watching what’s usually taking place behind closed doors unfolding in public, this battle that revealed to us the machinations of power and how they clash up against each other.”

‘Is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?’

But the reverberations of the proposed ESL were felt beyond personal relationships, beyond even soccer, as the project entangled Russian oligarchs, American hedge fund billionaires and Middle Eastern sheikhs – all of whom owned the clubs involved.

Even Prince William intervened, expressing his opposition to the idea, while then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to “drop a legislative bomb” to prevent the breakaway league forming.

Public opinion became another battleground, with UEFA decisively winning the PR war as the ESL plans were dismantled by fans, governments and other clubs within 48 hours of becoming public.

The documentary is balanced, offering the ESL architects’ reasoning and plans in extensive interviews, assembling almost the entire cast of characters to face off once more in the court of public opinion.

“That was how we presented it to them,” Zimbalist says.

“We’re going to hopefully have audiences in a tug of war where they, for 15 minutes at a time, are rooting for UEFA and the fans and the next 15 minutes they’re rooting for the Super League because they can identify with the personal experiences of the architects on either side and they understand the arguments.”

But Zimbalist was wary of casting the ESL as a battle between only two sides, constantly reminding himself and his team of the other groups.

“You can very easily just look at UEFA vs. the architects of the Super League,” he says. “But then you’re leaving out, in some ways, the most important voice, which is the fan voice.”

The entire documentary opens with the fans, lingering on the emotion provoked by football, and detailing the sport’s most fairytale-like stories such as unfancied Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016.

So much of football’s magic, almost every commentator and fan interviewed for the documentary says, comes from the drama of promotion and relegation which the ESL would have undermined.

It epitomizes the ideal that a club can rise from the lowest to the highest ranks of the sport; an idea that has been battered recently by the consolidation of wealth among the top few clubs, owned by mega-rich owners and able to simply buy the best players.

“This identity crisis in the sport – is it social democracy or is it capitalist utopia?” Zimbalist says. “If you look at the Super League story, capitalism may have its hands around the throat of the sport, but it hasn’t fully appropriated the sport either because the fans came out victorious.”

European governing body UEFA too emerged victorious, vowing to stop the “cynical project,” as seemingly, did football’s world governing body FIFA which threatened to expel clubs from international competitions.

The documentary, however, details FIFA’s more ambiguous position, its own financial competition with UEFA and its talks engaging with the nascent league, the documentary says.

‘The war for football rages on’

Still the conditions that led to the proposed ESL continue to plague European football as its organizers unveiled a reformed competition with “60 to 80 teams” earlier this month.

Zimbalist’s documentary delves deep into these themes, explaining the origins of the wage inflation first driven by “old money” clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United which are now in turn outspent by “new money” club such as PSG and Manchester City.

“We wanted to use this saga as a lens through which to understand the inner workings of a $40 billion a year industry,” he says.

“And ask big questions about can culture be owned? And how do you govern culture?”

For Barcelona and Juventus, their financial situations have only become more desperate during the last two years.

Juventus was docked 15 points earlier this month following an investigation into the Turin-based team’s representation of their player sales between 2018 and 2020, while the entire board of directors – including Agnelli – resigned in November amid an investigation from the public prosecutor’s office in Turin.

Barcelona’s already precarious financial situation has worsened following two consecutive group stage exits in the Champions League, and its president said in January that the ESL will become “a reality in 2025.”

But Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham told CNN’s Richard Quest last month that for them, “the Super League is in the past.”

“It was something that we apologized for and … going forward, it’s not something that we’re interested in.”

Meanwhile court cases arbitrating the league’s fallout rumble on.

An opinion issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in December that the measures FIFA and UEFA took to block the breakaway league were in line with European Union competition laws, a blow to the continuing proponents of the ESL.

The ECJ will issue its final judgement later this year.

The ESL in the incarnation that it was originally proposed seems unlikely to become a reality but the “ideas behind the Super League, the vision that it proposes, are likely to take other forms and to evolve,” Zimbalist says.

“Maybe the battle of this version of the Super League and is perhaps close to over. But the war for football rages on.”"

The Palestinian team has never taken part in a World Cup tournament, but the territory’s presence was very much in evidence at Qatar 2022.

Fans interrupted press interviews shouting “free Palestine,” while some Moroccan players held up the Palestinian flag after their historic quarterfinal win against Portugal, making the Atlas Lions the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a constant source of tension in the Middle East since the State of Israel’s creation in 1948, only made more tense after Israel’s capture of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in 1967.

Since the State of Israel’s creation – in what Palestinians call the “Nakba” and Israelis call Independence Day – clashes have been frequent.

“Nakba” means catastrophe in Arabic, evoking a period which saw approximately 700,000 Palestinians flee or be forced to leave their homes in what became Israel.

“The Israeli occupation doesn’t just affect me, but affects … Palestinian sports in general,” the Palestinian team’s goalkeeper Rami Hamadeh told CNN Sports.

“Whether it’s players being arrested or killed. Regardless of these restrictions, we are able to achieve our goals and perform well, and this shows in our 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.”

One such player was the 23-year-old Ahmed Daraghmeh. Palestinian officials said Daraghmeh, a local football player from the city of Tubas near Nablus, was fatally shot by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2022, according to Reuters. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, later claimed him as a member.

Palestinian athletes have also been arrested in the past. In 2009, Israeli authorities detained footballer Mahmoud Sarsak under Israel’s “illegal combatant” policy, colloquially known as administrative detention.

Under this policy, Israeli authorities can detain Palestinians indefinitely. Sarsak was released in 2012 following a hunger strike.

Israel alleged he was a member of the Islamic Jihad group. Sarsak rebutted those claims and said “I deny all the charges I am accused of. I am a sports person, I am a free footballer, I play for peace and the whole world, and I play for lifting the injustice of the Palestinian people.”

But last year’s AFC Asian Cup qualifiers proved to be a successful performance for the national team.

They beat the Philippines in the final round of the qualification stage with a 4-0 victory, granting them the third win in a row after beating Mongolia and Yemen.

Identification cards

Hamadeh, like 1.9 million other Palestinians living in Israel, holds Israeli citizenship and currently plays for local East Jerusalem team Jabal Al-Mukaber. He previously played for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin.

Despite the obstacles Palestinian athletes face, he says they continue to dream big.

“The ambition and the dream is always there for me as a player and the national team. I hope that the national team is able to qualify for the World Cup. It’s the biggest competition that any football player wishes to be part of,” the 28-year-old Hamadeh added.

Palestinian athletes’ movements are determined by what identification card they hold, which is issued by the Israeli military.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip hold green IDs, while Palestinians in Jerusalem hold blue IDs. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot travel to Gaza or Jerusalem unless they have a special Israeli-issued travel permit.

To play matches in football stadiums Palestinian football players must apply for permits to cross Israeli checkpoints, and permit approvals are unpredictable. In 2019, Israel denied travel permits to some players from a Gazan football team to participate in a tournament against another club in the West Bank.

The president of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) Jibril Rajoub told AP the denial was “clear evidence that this Israeli occupation is cruel but from our side we keep raising it to FIFA.”

In a survey conducted by London-based firm Henley & Partners, the Palestinian passport was ranked as one of the worst passports to hold in 2023, having visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 38 destinations, compared to Japan and the United States who enjoy access to over 100 destinations.

This can make it difficult for players to cross borders for qualifying competitions, leading them to cancel or forfeit.

In 2007, following the first leg of a play-off tie against Singapore, trailing 4-0, the Palestinian national football team failed to appear for the second match of the first round of FIFA 2010 qualifiers, making Singapore the automatic winners. Israel denied the players their travel permits from the Gaza Strip for travel to Singapore.

The politics of travel

Nicknamed the “Lions of Canaan” and the “Fedayeen,” the 30-strong Palestinian squad is coached by former Tunisian football player Makram Daboub, who told CNN that the politics of travel can be divisive.

“Our training base is in the West Bank, and I’m able to watch the matches here. But I can’t watch or train the players in Gaza because of movement restrictions. They can’t come to the West Bank either,” said Daboub.

The Gaza Strip is under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by the Israeli and Egyptian army since 2007. Entry is granted to mostly journalists, diplomats, and aid workers, and tight travel restrictions are imposed on Gazans for travel.

“Freedom of movement in terms of training camps or attending matches is difficult and in our case it takes around a day to be able to move somewhere that should take 20 or 30 minutes,” Daboub said.

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said, “Visa restrictions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the host country with the respective competition organizer. In the case of the Asian Cup, this is the AFC and FIFA of course for FIFA competitions with the host country or countries.”

Despite travel restrictions, the Palestinian team remains hopeful about their future prospects after qualifying for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup which has been postponed to January 2024.

With players scattered across various parts of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, Egypt, and Portugal, playing for their respective clubs, the Palestinian national football team has persisted through unique challenges.

Daboub became the team’s official coach in 2021 and believes the Palestinian squad has been steadily improving.

“We have been winning great achievements in the past couple of months. Qualifying for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup in Qatar and for the Asian Cup. It is an achievement to qualify for the Asian Cup, especially for the third time as the national team,” said Daboub.

In 2022, The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) revealed they are expanding the number of teams for the FIFA World Cup 2026 from 32 to 48. For the first time since 1998, this new format will give Asian teams four additional places to qualify bringing the total to eight.

While FIFA President Gianni Infantino mentioned at a press conference last year that FIFA was reconsidering the 48-team World Cup structure in future discussions, a spokesman for soccer’s world governing body told CNN Sports the structure won’t be changing anytime soon.

This will give the number of Asian teams more spots to qualify and compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and more possibilities for the Palestinian team.

The team will first showcase its talent at the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) Championship before competing in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

Both tournaments will be crucial for Asian teams ahead of the next World Cup qualifier matches.

“I believe we can compete in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At the 2023 Asian Cup qualification games in Mongolia, we won all three matches. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, we beat Uzbekistan 2-0 and played to a draw against Saudi Arabia,” said Yaser Hamed, who plays center back for the national team.

‘Love of football’

Despite not progressing to the 2022 World Cup – the Palestinian team managed to get to the second round of the Asian qualifiers out of a total of three stages – Hamed is positive about 2026.

Hamed was born in Spain to a Palestinian father and a Spanish mother, and references his dad as inspiration for his professional football career.

“When my father moved from Palestine to Spain, he started playing football and he loved it. So maybe the love of football comes from him. Maybe it’s from the Palestinian bloodline,” Hamed added.

Hamed, who scored his second national team goal in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Singapore, qualifies to play for Spain’s national football team if he’s called, but plays for the Palestinian national team instead, despite holding Spanish citizenship.

“I thought it was an amazing thing to play for the Palestinian national football team because I’m proud to be Palestinian. I need to use my voice for the Palestinian national team. It’s like I can fight for the country. This is very important for me,” said Hamed.

The road to FIFA 2026 begins this year, with the first stage of the continental qualifiers taking place on November 16, with two more stages continuing all the way through 2024 and 2025.

The PFA, led by president Rajoub and General Secretary Firas Abu Hilal, funded the creation of the football squad’s first medical program in 2022 after they qualified for the Asian Cup. That medical program consists of a medical doctor and a nutritionist, who oversee the players’ health and fitness.

Diala Shaheen, who is also the nutritionist for the Palestinian National Olympic Committee, works with the soccer players, monitoring their health and fitness.

“To be an elite athlete requires you to be aware of what you consume and how you prepare, your physical status. I can happily say we are seeing the results with the athletes we are working with and are confirming the changes in their body and their performance in their games,” said Shaheen.

“The nutritional support that’s added on a higher level for our national team is going to make a difference because this is something that was never done before. I believe the importance of such interventions in making a difference on a team level,” Shaheen told CNN Sports, who adds that Oday Dabbagh has been “shining” in the Portuguese league.

Dabbagh is the first homegrown Palestinian athlete to star in a top European league, according to the PFA – he plays for Portugal’s F.C. Arouca and will be transferring to Belgian league R. Charleroi S.C in June of this year.

Shaheen and the PFA believe this addition will elevate the Palestinian team’s future success at professional tournaments and increase their global stature.

Infrastructure projects

The football team received FIFA membership in 1998 after several attempts. However the relationship between the PFA and FIFA hasn’t always been smooth.

Over the years, the PFA has filed numerous complaints to FIFA and has condemned the world governing body for what it cites as an inability to intervene with Israel’s control over Palestinian sports.

In 2015, the PFA called for the suspension of the Israel Football Association’s (IFA) membership with FIFA.

They accused Israel of restricting movements of Palestinian players in the West Bank and objected to Israeli teams playing in what are labeled by international law as illegal settlements in the West Bank.

FIFA said Israel didn’t violate any rules which led the PFA to withdraw their complaint, allegedly due to pressure by FIFA delegates.

Despite these tensions with the PFA, the world governing body pointed out that through its “FIFA Forward Programme and in addition to operational funding, FIFA has invested nearly $2.1 million into specific football development projects to help the Palestinians.”

Additionally, FIFA’s football infrastructure projects “include the installation of a Futsal Hall as well as renovation and installation of artificial pitch at Faisal Al-Husseini Stadium,” according to FIFA.

General Secretary of the PFA Hilal told CNN Sports that the challenges the organization faces “won’t stop us from our plans.”

“This is our way as Palestinians to get the Palestinian message and the name of Palestine worldwide through football and through sport,” said Hilal.

“There are always clashes and limitations by the occupation, whether it is clashes happening in matches, or arresting athletes. But it’s known that existence is resistance for Palestinians, even in the world of sports,” Hilal added.

One such interruption during a football match was in 2019 when Israeli forces fired tear gas into a football stadium in Bethlehem, leaving Palestinian footballers to flee the pitch.

On an international level, the football association hasn’t hosted large tournaments because of the lack of infrastructure, according to general secretary Hilal.

Meanwhile in 2013, European soccer governing body UEFA granted Israel hosting rights for the European Under 21-Championships, which was hosted in Tel Aviv and three other cities, despite calls for boycotts from human rights groups.

While the FIFA World Cup 2026 is still three years away, the Palestinian national team is confident the West Asian and Asian Cups may help lead to a FIFA 2026 qualification.

“There’s a full plan to prepare our national team for the upcoming competitions, including the Asia Cup in January 2024 as well as the World Cup qualifications,” said General Secretary Abu Hilal.

“For 2026, we hope as the PFA and with the increase of the members in the World Cup, including the quota for Asia, that we are able to qualify for the World Cup,”

Coach Daboub goes even further.

“We’re going to do what Morocco did in the World Cup,” he said."

Novak Djokovic has achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, surpassing Steffi Graf to spend the most weeks at No. 1 in the world.

On Monday, Djokovic started his 378th week as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1, spending the most weeks in that spot since the ATP ranking system began in 1973.

A week ago, Djokovic matched the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) leader, Graf, who held the top spot for 377 weeks in her career.

“With your love and great strength that you have given me over the years, I’ve managed to achieve many fantastic achievements throughout my career,” Djokovic said in a video message to fans, shared by the ATP.

“The most recent one breaking the record of 378 weeks on No. 1 rankings, surpassing one of the greatest, most legendary tennis players – both men and women – that ever played, Steffi Graf. So I’m flattered, obviously extremely, extremely proud and happy for this achievement.”

Djokovic jumped back up to No. 1 when he won the Australian Open last month. It was his 22nd major title, tying him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis.

The 35-year-old will return to the court this week as the top seed in the Dubai Tennis Championships, his first tournament since the Australian Open.

The Serb has been out of action with a hamstring injury but told reporters he has been “pain free” for a week heading into his first match against the Czech Republic’s Tomás Machác on Tuesday.

It’s yet to be seen where and when Djokovic will play after Dubai, with his participation at next month’s Indian Wells and Miami Open tournaments in doubt.

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and Djokovic, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

“All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” Djokovic previously told reporters."

It’s an Olympic sport which has its origins in Ancient Greece, and which helped stars of the ring such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Nicola Adams, Claressa Shields and Katie Taylor become known to global audiences.

These days, however, Olympic boxing is on the ropes, bruised and battered by infighting.

USA Boxing accused the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) on Monday of possible “sabotage,” saying the IBA had announced a “false and misleading” qualification process for the 2024 Olympic Games.

It comes after tension between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as well as several boxing federations around the world, which has led to eight countries, including the US, boycotting the forthcoming women’s and men’s world championships, according to Reuters.

How did Olympic boxing reach this tipping point and what is next for the sport with Paris 2024 a little over a year away?

A long road

Tensions started to emerge in 2019.

A report, sanctioned by the IOC, into the IBA’s running of the sport recommended that the IBA be suspended from its right to organize the boxing tournament at the 2020 Olympics because of the “ongoing seriousness of the issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, and refereeing and judging.”

Serbian IOC member Nenad Lalovic delivered the report to the IOC executive, saying the IBA could reach a debt of as much as 29 million Swiss francs ($31 million) by the end of June 2021.

At the time, IBA interim president Mohamed Moustahsane said it was imperative for the organization to “come together and work together as a unit” so it can “continue to fight for our Olympic future.”

The IOC voted unanimously to implement the recommendations. In a statement, the IOC President Thomas Bach said there needed to be “fundamental change” before the suspension could be lifted and that the Olympic governing body’s decision was “taken in the interest of the athletes and the sport of boxing.”

As a result of its exclusion from the qualification process and the official Tokyo Games, the IBA lost the right to run the qualifications for the Tokyo 2020 Games. An IOC task force ran the qualification for Tokyo 2020 as well as the Games themselves.

In June 2022, the IOC maintained the suspension, making public the roadmap the IBA would have to follow, including financial transparency and changing its refereeing and judging process, before the IOC could consider lifting the sanctions in 2023.

A particular concern for the IOC was the IBA’s “financial dependency” on Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom, according to the IOC. Gazprom has been sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.

Midway through 2022, the IOC announced the qualification process for the 2024 Games in Paris and said the competition itself would once again not be run by the IBA due to the “continuing and very concerning issues” over governance, refereeing, and the judging system.

In a statement the IBA said it had been “dealing with significant governance issues,” which it said were a “burden from the past leadership.”

“We continue to be punished for a culture of corruption that was created and nourished by some of the individuals from the IOC’s upper echelon,” the statement added.

“This culture of corruption was developed over time and fixing it will take time to be done right, which has been ongoing for more than 2 years.”

The IBA is headed by Russian Umar Kremlev after he was elected in December, 2020.

Kremlev was re-elected unopposed in May, 2022 after Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled a month later that van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing.

IBA makes surprise announcement

On Monday, the IBA said its upcoming women’s and men’s world championships in New Delhi in March and Tashkent in May will in fact be “main qualification events” for Paris 2024.

The IBA’s announcement came after eight major boxing nations, including the US and the UK, announced they would boycott the events due to the IBA allowing Russian and Belarusian fighters to compete with their national flags and anthems, according to Reuters.

Athletes from both countries have been barred from competing under their nation’s banners – or competing in general – in many sports following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin’s troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.

Last year, the IBA announced it was permitting athletes from both Russia and Belarus to compete under their flags, at the time going against IOC guidelines which recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from competition.

In January, 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan as “neutral athletes.”

About a month later, the US and more than 30 other “like-minded” countries released a statement asking the IOC to reconsider its decision, and announced they were backing a proposed ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international sports.

The countries – including the UK, Canada and most of Europe – said in a joint statement that there is “no practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and Belarusian athletes.”

On Wednesday, the IOC reiterated its condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the “Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible.”

The IBA said it will offer support to any athlete from a boycotted nation to compete if they wish to and not fall foul of national federations choosing to “use geopolitics as a means to play political games within boxing.”

A series of regional qualification tournaments will provide the foundation of qualification for the Olympic Games next year after the system was approved by the IOC last September.

There will also be two world qualification tournaments early next year to complete the process.

In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC contradicted the IBA’s announcement, saying “the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024’s boxing qualifications and tournament.”

The statement said the IBA’s suspension was “still in force” and that “the only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022, published and distributed to NOCs and boxing National Federations on 6 December 2022.”

According to Reuters, boxing has yet to be confirmed for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, pending reforms demanded by the IOC.

USA Boxing reacts

In a statement on February 20, USA Boxing executive director, Mike McAtee, called the IBA’s announcement of qualifying tournaments “totally unacceptable” and said it “clearly intends to cause confusion in the United States and the world boxing community.”

“IBA is, at best, incompetent. At worst, USA Boxing believes this may be an attempt to sabotage the Olympic Qualification for Paris Olympic Games,” he said.

McAtee added that USA Boxing remained “committed to the Olympic movement” by following the IOC’s principles of “proper governance, promoting neutral third-party oversight of the field of play, condemning false and misleading information from IBA leadership and demanding transparent financial management.”

On Wednesday, Ukraine’s boxing federation (FBU) joined the other eight federations in boycotting the IBA’s world championships.

FBU vice president Oleg Ilchenko told public broadcaster Suspilne that Ukrainian atheltes will not participate in both the men’s and women’s championships.

“Our answer is clear – our athletes and representatives of the Boxing Federation of Ukraine do not compete where representatives of the aggressor countries, namely Russia and Belarus, will compete,” Ilchenko said, per Reuters.

Ilchenko added: “As long as the war is going on and as Russian troops are on the territory of our country … they will not participate.”"

During his rugby career, Campbell Johnstone built a reputation as a tough scrummager with “the best right shoulder in the game,” according to one of his former coaches.

He played three times for the All Blacks – a dream for thousands of young rugby players in New Zealand – and represented club teams at home and overseas.

But for all his commitment and uncompromising physicality on the pitch, Johnstone was also hiding a part of himself.

“I loved playing rugby,” he tells CNN Sport. “And then one day, this other side of me, my sexuality, was coming through and I liked guys.

“That didn’t fit the picture and that wasn’t part of my plan. I always pushed that to the back of my head and wouldn’t address it – just kept pushing it away and pushing it away and kept focusing on my goals.”

Last month, Johnstone became the first All Black to come out publicly as gay, around a decade after calling time on his rugby career.

The response to the announcement, he says, took him by surprise. New Zealand rugby stars Ruby Tui and Aaron Smith, among others, praised Johnstone for his bravery on social media, while sports minister Grant Robertson, who is openly gay, thanked him for “blazing this trail” and inspiring “future generations to be open, happy and comfortable.”

“So many people have sent messages of support,” says Johnstone. “Hundreds of people have sent messages telling of their story and their struggle and how rewarding or refreshing it was hearing me talk and come out.

“In that respect, it’s been really overwhelming and so positive.”

On top of his three Tests for the All Blacks in 2005, Johnstone, a prop forward, played 72 times for Canterbury and 38 times for the Crusaders. He moved to France in 2009 and went on to make more than 100 appearances for club side Biarritz.

Now, the 43-year-old says he is “at peace” in his private life. But he can still recall the anguish he faced in his playing days when he didn’t believe his sexuality aligned with his childhood dream of playing for the All Blacks.

“It was kind of like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place,” says Johnstone. “Here was this game and this sport that I loved and enjoyed so much, yet I couldn’t be myself. And I felt I was living a double life, basically.

“I’d go home and then the anxiety would rise and then I’d go out the door, go to training. But that, funnily enough, was the enjoyment side, and it gave me the relief, eased the stress a bit. Then I’d come home and realize that I’m not actually being truthful to my teammates.”

There are only a handful of openly gay men in the professional rugby community.

Former referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007, and two years later, former Wales international Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay top-level male rugby player.

Both Owens and Thomas have spoken about experiencing suicidal thoughts as they struggled to come to terms with their sexuality, while former Australia international Dan Palmer, who came out as gay in 2020, said he “routinely numbed” himself with a “heavy cocktail of opioids” during his playing career.

But Johnstone is optimistic about rugby’s future.

“As long as coaches and players are very open-minded and provide a very caring and supportive culture and framework within the team, then I think it’ll progress very well,” he says.

“I think rugby is a living culture and it’s always progressing and it’s progressing in the right directions.”

Johnstone never considered coming out during his playing days – largely because he’s always been a private person and “wasn’t 100% comfortable” with his sexuality at the time.

He’s now speaking publicly in the hope of empowering others to do the same.

“I was happy and very strong in my private life and everything like that, so I thought: ‘Yeah, okay, let’s address it and take away that stigma,’ because there’s always been this stigma around the All Blacks and who is the first one and things like that.

“If we can open that door and I can be the first one, then that stigma is gone and it just makes it easier and less stress or anxiety for other people if there are other people out there.”

After retiring from rugby, Johnstone undertook coaching roles in Spain, the US and New Zealand.

He recently visited one of his former clubs, the Crusaders, to share his story and highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment within a professional sports team – something he believes has a positive impact when it comes to the performance on the pitch.

“That, in a nutshell, will make your team stronger and more effective,” says Johnstone, “and you’ll get better results, I believe.”"

World tennis number one Novak Djokovic is hopeful for “a positive result” on US tennis tournament participation ahead of next month’s Indian Wells and Miami Open tournaments, after applying for special permission to play there.

The United States still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and the Serbian, who has previously confirmed that he remains unvaccinated, has now applied for special permission to enter the country ahead of both tournaments, which start on March 6 and March 20 respectively.

“Look, last year I did miss both Indian Wells, Miami and all the US Open swing,” 22-time grand slam winner Djokovic told reporters in Belgrade on Wednesday.

“So it wouldn’t be the first time if it does happen. I mean, I hope it doesn’t, but that’s all I can do. All I can do is hope at the moment because, you know, my position stays the same. There’s not much else I can do except wish for a positive result,” he said.

Casting an eye to the US Open grand slam at the end of August, the 35-year-old said: “Well, (the) US Open is still far away, you know, it’s six months away. So I, I hope that I will be able to be there. I can’t give you any additional answers really to that. You know, US Open is one of the four biggest events in the history of our sport. So, of course, I would love to be there.

“(I’ve) received the most beautiful reception and support (from) the New York and American crowd during the finals of 2021, that I, unfortunately, lost to [Daniil] Medvedev. But I experienced something that I never experienced in New York, so I really want to go back and connect with people even more and, hopefully, play the best tennis and eventually get another trophy there,” the 22-time grand slam champion said.

When asked about whether the controversy regarding his Covid-19 vaccine stance has affected his tennis, Djokovic replied, “Well, I think (that) the recent results in Australia show that it doesn’t affect my tennis much.”

Djokovic returned to world No. 1 when he won a record 10th Australian Open last month. It was his 22nd major title, which tied him with Rafael Nadal for the most grand slam singles titles in men’s tennis history.

This week, the 35-year-old achieved another milestone in his illustrious tennis career, equaling Steffi Graf’s record for the most weeks as world No. 1.

Djokovic already holds the record for the most weeks as men’s world No. 1, surpassing Roger Federer’s mark of 310 weeks in March 2021, and on Monday, he drew level with German great Graf by beginning his 377th week in the top spot.

He next takes to the court at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, which gets underway on February 27."

Most No. 1 draft picks have time to enjoy their success, celebrating with family and friends, or dreaming about their future professional sports careers.

Not so for soccer star Alyssa Thompson, who had to think about the more pressing matter of her classes the next morning.

The 18-year-old Thompson made headlines when she was selected as the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NWSL draft by Angel City FC in January, becoming the first high schooler in history to be drafted in the history of the league.

“I was very nervous,” she tells CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies.

“And just like all the emotions were coming to me at that moment. I just was really shocked and couldn’t believe this is really happening right now.”

Not to be overwhelmed by her status as a new NWSL star, the senior at Harvard-Westlake is adamant that she is still focused on school, even if she has to juggle her studies with a professional soccer career.

“Once I’m done with practice, I don’t have another thing to do. So I think I’ll do my schoolwork,” she says. “As long as it gets me to graduate, I’ll do it.”

Thompson is no stranger to balancing school and soccer – whether its weekend trips to tournaments or training camps – and in October she went one better, making her debut for the US Women’s National Team in a friendly against European Champion England in London.

In front of a packed-out Wembley Stadium, Thompson was subbed on for USWNT superstar Megan Rapinoe, a moment that will stay with her for life.

“That was so crazy! I don’t know how to describe it. I was just really nervous, and I was going in for Megan Rapinoe!” she recalls. “I don’t think I was even processing it in the moment.”

Thompson will have to get used to lining up with the biggest stars in the sport. Angel City boasts a line-up of celebrity owners, including Serena Williams, Natalie Portman, Becky G, Eva Longoria and Mia Hamm.

And the stars are not limited to the sidelines. When the NWSL season kicks off next month, Thompson will be a part of an all-star team featuring two-time world champion Christen Press and Thompson’s personal hero Sydney Leroux.

Inspiring on and off the field

Thompson is not only breaking records as the first high school No. 1 draft pick. She also became the first player of Peruvian and Filipino heritage to be picked at No. 1, something that is not lost on her.

Despite her youth, Thompson doesn’t simply want to play soccer, but she also wants to be the inspiration for the next generation of girls playing the game.

“I think that being able to be a woman of color just as a role model for little girls is such an amazing thing,” she tells CNN Sport. “Being able to look up to someone that looks like them is such a cool thing to have.”

Thompson is used to being a role model having served as one for her younger sisters, Gisele and Zoe, her whole life. Both want to emulate Thompson’s success.

Gisele is already on that path after becoming the first high school player, along with Alyssa, to sign a name, image and likeness deal with Nike. She also has emulated her older sister by playing for the USWNT youth teams, featuring at the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup.

The pair have been inseparable, playing together from when they could walk all the way to the present, where they have featured together for the Total Futbol Academy of MLS Next, a boys’ team in Southern California.

Despite Thompson’s youth, she already sees herself as far more than just an athlete – someone who has the power to inspire a new generation of soccer players in the US.

“For my youngest sister, Zoe, being able to just be an inspiration for her and a role model for her to look up to, I think has really helped me put things into perspective for what I really want to do and how I want to be a role model for little kids,” she says.

While making her NSWL debut in Los Angeles is first on Thompson’s to-do list, the far bigger prize is in Australia and New Zealand in the shape of the Women’s World Cup, which kicks off in July.

Having tasted international senior soccer in October and now training regularly with USWNT players at club level, Thompson is hungry to be a part of the biggest showpiece in women’s soccer.

It’s a tall order for the young striker. The US boasts the deepest pool of players to choose from of any team and is coming into the tournament as the reigning champion, albeit on a low ebb.

Both of Thompson’s appearances for the team came in losses to England and Spain before the US lost to Germany, marking the first time the team has lost three games in a row since 1993.

Head coach Vlatko Andonovski has very little margin for error as he looks to lead the US to a third consecutive title and Thompson will have to seriously impress if she wants to make it onto the plane heading across the Pacific.

“I’m going to do everything that I can to be able to make the roster and I’m just going to work hard towards that goal,” Thompson says.

“If I continue to grow as a player and continue to thrive in the NWSL environment, then I feel like I have a chance.”

A slim chance, maybe, but Thompson is no stranger to making the seemingly impossible look routine."

There have been a lot of dull outfits on the fairways over the years – monochrome colors, polo shirts, and plain caps galore. Sometimes a flock of enthusiastic fans in Tiger onesies is the height of stylistic expression at a PGA Tour event.

Yet every now and then, a budding fairway fashionista pushes the envelope and makes a wardrobe decision that proves that golf can, in fact, serve up some memorable looks.

Whether they are memorable for the right reasons is another debate entirely. While Payne Stewart’s sartorial elegance and seemingly bottomless wardrobe of knickers saw his fashion reputation transcend golf, there was also the wearable eyesore that was Team USA’s 1999 Ryder Cup outfit – so bad that Tiger Woods confessed to burning it for warmth.

Some looks became a signature. Head to toe in fluorescent orange? Had to be Rickie Fowler. Cowboy hat and belt? Shingo Katayama was in town. And for absolutely everything in between, the unmatched John Daly – perhaps the only golfer in history you could bank on to make the fashion statement at whichever event he was playing that week.

He may only be 23 years old, but Armand Duplantis is already a sporting great.

An Olympic, World and European champion already, the Swedish athlete has become accustomed to also breaking world records.

And he did so again on Saturday, breaking the pole vault word record for the sixth time at the All Star Perche 2023 event in Clermont-Ferrand, France.

Duplantis added a centimeter to the world record of 6.21m he had previously set at the World Championships in Oregon last year.

He achieved the new world record of 6.22m on his third attempt having hit the bar with his previous two tries.

As he landed on the mat and the crowd went wild in celebration, sparklers went off at the historic moment and Duplantis was embraced by Renaud Lavillenie, the gold medal winner at the 2012 Olympics and the tournament’s organizer, who ran to celebrate with Duplantis.

Duplantis first broke the world record when he surpassed Lavillenie’s world record of 6.17m, which the Frenchman had set in 2014, in February 2020.

Over the course of the next two years, he went onto break his own record four more times before Saturday’s momentous achievement.

Duplantis had already won the competition when he cleared 6.01m with Australian Kurtis Marschall finishing second with 5.91m.

It was the 60th time Duplantis has jumped clear of six meters or higher as he continues his dominant career.

Ukrainian pole vault legend Sergey Bubka was the first man to surpass the six meter mark when he did so in 1985. He held the world record until Lavillenie outjumped his mark in an event in Bubka’s home city of Donetsk which had him in attendance."

And world No. 3 Jessica Pegula revealed the unglamorous side of the sport in a funny tweet after losing 6-1 5-7 6-0 to Barbora Krejčíková in the Dubai Championships semifinals on Friday.

“Everyone: “What is it like playing on tour? It must be so amazing!”

“Me: gets bagled on your birthday, sitting eating Doritos at midnight, waiting to get on a 16 hr flight home,” the American tweeted, alongside a selfie of her eating the crisps.

As well as reaching the semifinals in Dubai, Pegula reached the final of the Qatar Open last week, where she was defeated by the in-form Iga Swiatek.

“In all seriousness, “Pegula added in a follow-up tweet, “proud of my efforts the past two weeks. Time for some rest.”

Pegula has emerged as one of the top players on tour in the last two seasons, rising to a career high ranking in singles and doubles.

But, although the result on Friday didn’t go her way, at least she still celebrated her 29th birthday with Coco Gauff, the world No. 6.

“Our (mostly mine) terrible vocals of your birthday song,” Gauff tweeted in response. “But at least the cake was good.”"

The Nanterre prosecutor’s office, just outside of Paris, is leading the investigation, the source added.

Spanish-born Moroccan Hakimi is a full-back for Paris Saint-Germain and plays for the Moroccan national side. He scored the penalty kick that took Morocco to the World Cup semifinals during Qatar 2022.

“The Nanterre prosecutor’s office does not wish to comment on this ongoing investigation, as the information already published jeopardizes the inquiries necessary for finding the truth,” the prosecutor’s office told CNN.

CNN has reached out to Hakimi and PSG for comment.

Hakimi, who is considered one of the best defenders in the world, joined PSG from Inter Milan in 2021. He now plays alongside superstars such as Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappé.

Due to his impressive performances at both club and international levels last year, the 24-year-old was named in the men’s best XI at FIFA’s annual awards ceremony in Paris on Monday."

It had been 2,836 days since Chris Kirk last won on the PGA Tour. Yet after securing his first victory in over seven years on Sunday, that was not the first milestone the American golfer had on his mind.

A nail-biting playoff victory over compatriot Eric Cole at The Honda Classic in Florida sealed the American’s fifth PGA Tour title, and his first since he committed to sobriety almost four years ago.

“I owe everything that I have in my entire life to my sobriety,” Kirk told reporters at PGA National Resort.

“I wouldn’t be doing this for a living anymore. I probably wouldn’t have the family that I have currently anymore. I came really close to losing everything that I cared about.

“For that to have happened and worked out for me, obviously there was some decisions that I made, but mostly the grace of God and a lot of other people that really helped me along the way.

“It’s something that’s constantly on my mind, so it’s pretty easy for me to see that winning the Honda Classic is kind of a bonus when literally every good thing I have in my life I owe to that.”

‘I got sober because of you’

On the eve of his 34th birthday in May 2019, Kirk announced he would be taking an “indefinite leave” from golf to deal with his alcohol abuse and depression.

“I thought I could control it, but after multiple relapses, I have come to realize I can’t fix this on my own,” Kirk added in a social media post.

By that point his world ranking, which had peaked at 16th after his fourth PGA Tour victory at the Colonial tournament in 2015, had plummeted to 188th. He had failed to make the cut in four consecutive events, missing a total of 11 over just 17 events in the 2018-19 PGA Tour season.

A tied-15th finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational represented Kirk’s sole top-40 finish of the campaign.

When he returned to the Tour at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November 2019, his rank had fallen even further – he was world No. 303 – but Kirk was a rejuvenated man.

A candid interview with the PGA Tour on the eve of his comeback shed light on the golfer’s previous multiple unsuccessful attempts to give up alcohol.

Kirk, who said there was a history of alcoholism in his family, added he had given up beer in late 2017, switching to wine and hard liquor such as vodka and bourbon. That switch had been a decision to tackle his increasing weight, but it only served to “accelerate” his alcohol issues.

For Kirk, his openness had simply been about personal catharsis. Subsequently, the response from others has blown him away.

“It’s been a lot of people that have reached out to me directly and said, ‘I read your story or I heard your story and that made me decide that it was time [to quit],” Kirk said.

“When I first came back to playing and was very open and honest about it, that was not in my mind at all. It was more … for me because I felt I had lived this life for a number of years where I was just lying to myself, lying to my family, hiding a lot of things.

“So the honesty of the process that I went through to get better just felt so good that I had nothing to hide, and so it was just the natural thing for me to do.

“But now on the back end a little bit, it’s been amazing. Like I said, it’s not something that I really saw happening, but to be able to connect with people and … for somebody to say, ‘I got sober because of you, and my life has changed because of you,’ you can’t really describe how unreal that is with words.”

Augusta calling

On Sunday, disaster looked to have struck for Kirk at the 18th when his second shot went sailing into the water hazard to the right of the hole.

The American recovered well, but his subsequent bogey saw him drop into a playoff against Cole, his 34-year-old compatriot – ranked 330th in the world ahead of the event – who was chasing his maiden PGA Tour title.

For both players, it marked their first experience of a PGA Tour playoff, and for Kirk, it meant a replay of the hole that had nearly crushed him moments earlier.

Again, Kirk looked to be sliding towards a heartbreaking collapse when his tee shot settled near a tree. However, an incredible response saw the 37-year-old spark a 267-yard effort to the greenside bunker before almost holing his subsequent eagle approach shot from the sand.

When Cole’s birdie putt agonizingly rolled around the lip’s hole, Kirk tapped home for birdie and victory.

As well as securing him $1,512,000 in prize money, Sunday’s triumph jumps Kirk to the world No. 32 spot and sixth in the FedEx Cup rankings. Just as sweetly, it clinches him a spot at The Masters in April and the opportunity to take his wife and three sons to Augusta.

“I’ve been watching that World Ranking closely, trying to stay in the top 50, but to take care of it this week, that’s going to be something that’s incredibly special,” Kirk said.

“That par-3 contest can’t come soon enough. I’m really looking forward to that. The whole week, but just to be able to make those memories with my wife and my kids will be awesome.”

On Thursday, Kirk will tee off in Orlando for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Celebrating victory with a diet coke alongside friends on Sunday, the eve of the tournament will mark the first chance for Kirk to toast his victory with family.

“It’ll be a lot of celebrating, and I thank God that alcohol won’t be a part of it,” Kirk said."

After a dominant unbeaten run, Iga Świątek was finally beaten as she was stunned by Barbora Krejčíková in final of Dubai Tennis Championships.

The world No. 1 had dropped just nine games en route to the final – the fewest ever to reach a WTA 1000 final – surpassing the previous record of 10 held by Serena Williams in 2013.

But in the final, she faced an inspired Krejčíková, with the Czech player winning 6-4 6-2.

It is the second time she has beaten Poland’s Świątek in the final of a tournament in recent months, having won at the AGEL Open in her home country in October of last year.

And the former world No. 2 grabbed a memorable title, her first of the year, by beating the scorching hot Świątek in 91-minutes in Dubai.

Upset

After victory at the Qatar Open last week, Świątek was the in form player of those making the short trip to Dubai.

And she kept up her red-hot form by reaching the final, meaning she dropped just 14 games in the six matches she played before Saturday’s final.

Świątek became the second player ever to reach six WTA 1000 finals before turning 22 since Caroline Wozniacki in 2009.

But in Krejčíková, she faced inspired opposition.

The 27-year-old gave no quarter throughout, breaking Świątek midway through the opening set before claiming an important one set lead.

And she never relinquished it, once again breaking the three-time grand slam winner to claim a famous victory.

It means that after beating world No. 2 Ons Jabeur and No. 3 Jessica Pegula in the previous two rounds, Krejčíková becomes the fifth player to beat the top three ranked players at the same event.

She defeated four top-10 players at the Dubai Tennis Championships this year, which is as many as in her previous 24 tournaments played.

And as a result, Krejčíková is scheduled to rise from No. 30 to No. 16 in the world rankings."

Embattled French Football Federation (FFF) president Noël Le Graët has resigned, the federation announced in a statement on Tuesday.

“Noël Le Graët announced today to the Executive Committee of the French Football Federation his decision to leave his position,” the FFF said in the statement.

It added: “The FFF would like to salute the remarkable sporting and economic results of Noël Le Graët.”

FFF vice president Philippe Diallo has been announced as the interim president until June 10, 2023, the date of the next federation meeting.

Le Graët has been president of the FFF since 2011 and his mandate was due to run until 2024.

Last month, the 81-year-old chose to step down from his role as president “until the completion of the audit performed by the sports ministry.”

According to Reuters, the audit said that Le Graët had displayed “inappropriate behaviour … towards women” and that he no longer had the “necessary legitimacy” to work in French sport.

Le Graët has denied any wrongdoing, Reuters reported. CNN has contacted his lawyers and the FFF for further comment.

Last month, Le Graët also drew the ire of players and politicians for comments about French legend Zinedine Zidane.

In an interview with radio station RMC in January, Le Graët said he “wouldn’t even have taken [a] call” from Zidane when asked whether the World Cup winner had called to express an interest in taking over as the men’s national team coach from Didier Deschamps.

He later apologized to Zidane for the remarks.

Le Graët has been credited with reviving the French team having been in charge of the FFF when Les Bleus won the World Cup in 2018 and lost in the final against Argentina last year.

But he also has a record of making controversial comments, saying in 2019 that he is “totally against” the interruption of football matches as a result of homophobic chants and banners.

“I would not stop the games. I do not want to be held hostage on homophobia. There are security services to ensure that these banners disappear,” Le Graët told radio station France Info at the time."

A prominent human rights group has written to Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali to raise serious concerns over what it claims is the sport’s ongoing role in “sportswashing” ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix.

The new season gets underway in Bahrain on March 5, ahead of which the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) has urged F1 and the FIA, motorsport’s governing body, not to “sportswash the blood-soaked images” of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, which hosts a race on March 19.

“Sportswashing” refers to governments using high-profile sporting events to project a favorable image of their country around the world, often to draw attention away from alleged wrongdoing.

“Despite horrific human rights records, both states enjoy generous F1 contracts and exploit the F1 platform to sanitize their image on the world stage, while thousands of political prisoners languish behind bars,” Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, BIRD’s Advocacy Director, said in a statement commenting on the letter on Monday.

“F1 must establish an independent and impartial inquiry to examine the role of their races in human rights violations, and the FIA must adopt a human rights policy consistent with UN principles.

“Failure to do so will allow their sport to continue to be used to repair the reputation of brutal dictators.”

In response to BIRD, an F1 spokesperson in a statement to CNN: “For decades Formula 1 has worked hard be a positive force everywhere it races, including economic, social, and cultural benefits.

“Sports like Formula 1 are uniquely positioned to cross borders and cultures to bring countries and communities together to share the passion and excitement of incredible competition and achievement.

“We take our responsibilities very seriously and have made our position on human rights and other issues clear to all our partners and host countries who commit to respect human rights in the way their events are hosted and delivered.”

The FIA, motorsport’s governing body told CNN it “cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.”

“The FIA, as is the case with other international sporting federations, cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state,” said an FIA spokesperson in a statement on Monday.

“This independence from the affairs of states, as underlined by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), does not mean however that we are insensitive to any potential hardships endured by the people concerned.

“At the pinnacle of motor sport, F1 events take place across a huge spectrum of different countries and cultures around the world,” added the FIA statement.

“It is our belief that the most fundamental goal of motor sport, and all sport, is founded on the desire to increase our common ground and cultivate the principles of cooperation and commonality between people.

“The FIA will continue to work on projects that bring positive benefits to the wider society, acting always within its scope as the regulator of world motor sport,” the federation added.

CNN has reached out to the Bahrain Supreme Council for Youth and Sports and the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Sport for comment.

This is not the first time that F1 has come under the spotlight for hosting races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.

In 2020, seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton said the sport has a “massive issue” with human rights ahead of competing in Bahrain.

But speaking to CNN Sports days after Hamilton’s comments, former F1 CEO Chase Carey said the sport has been “very clear about our commitment to human rights” and is “very proud of our partnership here in Bahrain.”"

Buffalo Bills general manager Brandon Beane said he “would love to give the storybook ending” to Damar Hamlin’s recovery from a cardiac arrest, but admitted it’s still unclear whether the 24-year-old would play again.

Hamlin collapsed after making a tackle in a game between the Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals on January 2.

Doctors and trainers administered CPR and used a defibrillator on the field to resuscitate him, after which he was transferred to medical centers in Cincinnati and Buffalo before being released on January 11.

The cause of the cardiac arrest, which meant Hamlin’s heart abruptly stopped beating, has not been determined.

On Tuesday, Beane said Hamlin is “doing great” as he continues his recovery but needs full medical clearance if he wants to play again.

“If he’s able to get full clearance and he feels he’s ready to do it, that’s another big smile of a story. Not that he’s just got his life back, but he would have his football career back and have an opportunity to go out there and play,” Beane told reporters at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis.

“We’ll continue to support Damar through this whole thing. I would love to give the storybook ending that he’s definitely going to play, but we just don’t know that yet. If he does, we’ll all be very happy for him.”

Speaking on Good Morning America last month, Hamlin said he feels “great” physically but is still “working through things” emotionally.

He said a potential return to the sport is a “tough situation” as it will ultimately be up to him, rather than doctors, to make that call.

“It will be a decision for Damar, but it will also be a decision for us,” Beane continued.

“We want to make sure we’re hearing everything. Assuming he gets full clearance, I know he would want to play. I know that’s his endgame: to continue playing.

“We want to make sure that we’re all in sync, assuming the doctors say at some point, he’s seen them all [and] we’re in agreement that we’re okay putting him out there, too. So far, all is well with his testing and we’ll just let that continue.”

Beane said that Hamlin has seen several specialists since the NFL season concluded and that there are two or three more specialists he has to see."

It was party time in Missouri on Wednesday as the Chiefs continued their celebrations after Sunday’s Super Bowl win with a parade through the streets of Kansas City and a rally where two-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes told the crowd he was planning to see them in the same place next year.

At the rally, Mahomes, who was selected MVP for the NFL season and for the Super Bowl, lauded the Chiefs fans and said the future hold more big wins.

“This is just the beginning. We ain’t done yet,” Mahomes told the massive crowd in front of Union Station. “So I’ll make sure to hit y’all back next year, and I hope the crowd’s the same.”

For the Chiefs’ last Super Bowl win in 2020, it was estimated that between 800,000 and 1 million fans lined the streets to celebrate and early indications showed that number was likely to be matched.

Despite the parade getting underway at midday local time, some fans had been waiting by the side of the road since 6 a.m. CT to ensure they were in prime position to see the parade go by.

The celebrations began in a somewhat organized fashion as the Chiefs’ team buses made their way through the streets in a line. However, the buses soon got separated from each other as the players got off to celebrate with the fans.

Some took selfies, signed autographs and gave out hugs, while others handed out beers to delighted supporters.

Once again, boisterous tight end and hype man Travis Kelce pumped up the crowd, then said: “Chiefs kingdom, we do this for you. … And we love every single time you make Arrowhead (Stadium) shake.”

He said it was the best season of his life and thanked the fans, his teammates and members of the Chiefs’ organization.

“Everyone’s asking if this is a dynasty, it’s been a dynasty,” he said, alluding to three Super Bowl appearances in five seasons and two titles.

Free beer was becoming something of a theme, with Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles announcing in a bar before the parade that fans present would receive free Bud Light – those that were 21 and over of course.

A few lucky fans even got the chance to touch the famous Vince Lombardi Trophy as Chiefs defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi cradled it and took it over to the where they were lined up.

Supporters went into a frenzy when Mahomes, who was wearing a WWE World Championship belt on the bus, and Kelce, accompanied by his now-famous mom Donna, went past giving out high fives.

Mahomes in particular looked to be having a blast, dancing at the back of the bus with his MVP award in one hand and and a beer in the other.

The Chiefs offensive line even had special t-shirts made for the occasion, with Trey Smith wearing one that read “0 sacks” and Orlando Brown Jr. one that read “0 sacks, put it on a f****** t-shirt.”

Preventing Mahomes, who was suffering with an ankle sprain, from being sacked in the Super Bowl was clearly a matter of great pride.

Twitter beef

The day before the parade, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was still ruffling the Eagles’ feathers.

Smith-Schuster posted a mock Valentine’s Day card to his Twitter account bearing the face of Philadelphia’s James Bradberry, along with the caption “I’ll hold you when it matters most.”

The cheeky post was a reference to Bradberry being whistled for a controversial holding penalty for tugging at Smith-Schuster’s jersey late in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s Super Bowl.

The penalty allowed the Chiefs to run out the clock and then kick a championship-winning field goal.

Eagles wide receiver AJ Brown was less than impressed with Smith-Schuster’s tweet.

“First off congratulations,” he replied on Twitter. “Y’all deserve it. This is lame. You was on the way out the league before Mahomes resurrected your career on your 1 year deal Tik-Tok boy.

“He admitted that he grabbed you but don’t act like your (sic) like that or ever was. But congratulations again!”

Brown’s “Tik Tok boy” remark sent Twitter users into a frenzy, a reference to Smith-Schuster’s penchant for performing dance routines made famous by the social media app while on the field."

YouTuber Jake Paul suffered the first defeat of his fledgling boxing career on Sunday night as pro boxer-turned reality TV star Tommy Fury edged him out in a split decision in Saudi Arabia.

Two judges both scored the fight 76-73 for Fury, with the third judge ruling 75-74 in favor of Paul at the end of their eight-round cruiserweight bout at the Diriyah Arena near the capital Riyadh.

“In my first main event, 23 years old, I had the world on my shoulders, and I came through,” Fury said after the fight. “This, to me, is a world title fight. I trained so hard for this. This was my destiny.”

Paul, a 26-year-old American with more than 20 million YouTube subscribers, is now 6-1 while Fury, the British younger half-brother of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, remains undefeated with nine wins after taking time out of his boxing career in 2019 to star in reality show “Love Island.”

Millions of fans were expected to tune into the fight, the latest pay-per-view bout involving a YouTuber to generate a social media buzz as promoters played up the bad blood between the two fighters. And just like a genuine world title fight, there were plenty of stars ringside, including former champ Mike Tyson, soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and comedian Kevin Hart.

Fury asserted his jab early to keep Paul at a distance but the YouTuber gained momentum in the fifth round, appearing to stun Fury.

Both had points deducted – Paul in the fifth for pushing his opponent’s head down while clinching and Fury in the sixth for too much clinching, a defensive tactic that’s often only allowed for short periods of time.

Fury was knocked down in the eighth round on a short-left hand by Paul but it was too late as the judges ruled in Fury’s favor.

Paul said he intended to use a rematch clause for Sunday’s fight that could be exercised if Fury won.

“All respect to Tommy, he won, don’t judge me by my wins, judge me by my losses. I’ll come back, I thought I deserve that rematch, it was a great fight, a close fight,” Paul said after the fight.

Paul only began boxing in 2018, but had since gone on to record six wins prior to Sunday – including four knockouts. Fury, however, was the first professional boxer Paul faced."

Tick tock, tick tock. The new MLB rules are coming fast at players; just ask Cal Conley.

The Atlanta Braves hitter looked as confused as everyone else on Saturday when the new pitch clock regulation sparked confusion during a spring training game between the Braves and the Boston Red Sox.

With the game tied at 6-6, Conley was sitting on a full count against Robert Kwiatkowski.

However, as the pitch clock hit eight seconds, umpire John Libka jumped in to award strike three with Conley not yet squared up to receive the delivery.

Confused by what had just happened, Conley appeared to jog towards first base thinking that it was Kwiatkowski who had received a time violation for taking too long to pitch his delivery.

“Me?” questioned a baffled Conley, pointing towards himself before it dawned on him that he was being penalized.

The new MLB rules state that hitters must be ready in the batter’s box with eight seconds remaining and Conley was not still going through his preparation at that point.

A league source confirmed to CNN that Libka made the correct call in the game.

With players, fans and coaching staff inside the CoolToday Park all looking confused, the game ended in a 6-6 draw in a chorus of boos.

For Braves manager Brian Snitker, the incident was a reminder that players must instantly adapt to the new rules.

“These are the kind of things that tell you why we’re starting this right now,” he told reporters.

“You never know what might happen. That instance right there shows you what could happen.”

Speeding things up

The new MLB rules are designed to speed up play, with baseball games taking an average of more than three hours to finish.

They dictate that pitchers have 15 seconds to complete a delivery with bases empty and 20 seconds with runners on bases. In addition, batters will be limited to one timeout per plate appearance, and there will also be a 30-second timer between hitters.

New regulations also mean the size of the three bases have grown from 15 inches to 18 inches in the hope of reducing injuries.

If the new rules for the 2023 season are going to usher in a new, faster era for the sport, then it looks likely that players are going to need time to adapt.

However, the changes are being welcomed by some.

“If this is going to be the pace of these games, I’m OK with it,” Padres manager Bob Melvin told reporters. “First look, so far, so good.”

Teams have the remaining of the preseason to make mistakes before more is at stake when the season starts for real on March 30. Tick tock, tick tock."

Byron Jones, who was selected in the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys, tweeted Saturday that injuries sustained playing football have left him unable to run or jump, and he advised other players to be wary of the pills and injections doled out by team doctors.

“Much has changed in 8 years. Today I can’t run or jump because of my injuries sustained playing this game,” Jones tweeted.

“DO NOT take the pills they give you. DO NOT take the injections they give you. If you absolutely must, consult an outside doctor to learn the long-term implications.”

Representatives for the cornerback have not responded to CNN’s request for more clarity on his statements.

The 30-year-old former Pro Bowler has played for the Cowboys and Miami Dolphins in his 8-year NFL career. Jones spent the 2022 season on the physically unable to perform list as a member of the Dolphins.

CNN has reached out to the Cowboys and Dolphins as well as the NFL for response to Jones’ statement.

“It was an honor and privilege to play in the NFL but it came at a regrettable cost I did not foresee,” Jones tweeted after his initial post. “In my opinion, no amount of professional success or financial gain is worth avoidable chronic pain and disabilities.

“Godspeed to the draft class of 2023.”

It’s unclear whether Jones, who is still on the Dolphins’ roster, intends to retire from the NFL."

Supporters of Turkish soccer team Fenerbahçe, who chanted anti-government slogans during a previous match, have been banned from attending this weekend’s game against Kayserispor, according to a team statement.

Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber confirmed the decision on Tuesday, saying visiting fans will not be allowed inside the stadium as Fenerbahçe travels to Kayseri, Turkey.

According to TRT Haber, the decision was made due to “security reasons” following a meeting held by the Provincial Security Board.

“We have learned with surprise that our supporters will not be allowed to be in the stadium when we play against Yukatel Kayserispor on Saturday, March 4, 2023, a decision taken by the Kayseri Provincial Security Board,” the statement read.

Fenerbahçe said it is “in no way possible” for the team to accept the decision, calling it a “strange one that has nothing to do with sportive criteria, in a way that will deepen the social polarization.”

“It has no meaning other than hindering our fans’ desire to support our team and punishing our Club,” the Fenerbahçe statement added.

The team demanded to know on what grounds its supporters were banned and called on those involved in the decision to review it.

At a match on Saturday, Fenerbahçe fans chanted anti-government slogans calling for its resignation, amid criticisms of the government’s response to earthquake relief efforts.

In a statement on Sunday, Kayserispor, the host team of the city where this weekend’s upcoming match will be played, released a statement condemning “abasement that tries to dominate the stadiums.”

“We present to the public that the Kayserispor community stands by the state and the nation, shares our national pain from the heart in these disaster days, is against the dirty politics and abasement that tries to dominate the stadiums, and we condemn this,” the team said.

Some Beşiktaş fans also chanted “government resign” in protest against the official response to the disaster during the club’s game against Antalyaspor on Sunday.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s partner in government, the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) head Devlet Bahçeli, called for soccer games to be played without fans and ended his Beşiktaş membership in light of the anti-government chants.

On Sunday, fans also showered the stadium with teddy bears and other stuffed toys. They will be sent by Beşiktaş to children impacted by the earthquake."

Chicago White Sox Minor League baseball player Anderson Comas announced he is “proudly and happily part of the LGTBQ+ community,” in an Instagram post on Sunday.

“I’m also a human with a great soul, I’m respectful, I’m a lover, I love my family and friends and that’s what really matters, I enjoy my work a lot, being a professional baseball player is the best thing that happened to me so I just wanna say something to those people that says that gay people can not be someone in this life, well look at me I’m Gay and I’m a professional athlete so that didn’t stopped (sic) me to make my dreams come true,” Comas said.

Comas, 23, is a converted outfielder who now pitches. He spent last season in the White Sox single A team, the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers in North Carolina.

He warned that his Instagram post was not for everyone.

“If you’re homophobic this post may not (be) for you….so you can see we all matters and we all are the same…

“I’m doing this cause I wanna be an inspiration for those like me out there fitting for their dreams, please don’t listen to those stupid things that people say about us, fight for your dreams, believe in yourself and go for it,” he added.

Chris Getz, White Sox assistant general manager/player development, said the team was “proud” of Anderson and confirmed he “first shared his news with us last year,” in a Chicago White Sox tweet on Sunday.

“And I was very pleased that he was comfortable sharing with us in player development. I also was happy at the reaction across the organization, which as you would expect was to support, help and congratulate a teammate. With his social media post today, we are so proud of Anderson and that he is comfortable sharing such an important personal part of his life so openly,” Getz added.

Comas joins pitcher Solomon Bates, who came out as gay after being released in 2022 when he was a minor leaguer in the Giants organization, and former Brewers farmhand David Denson, who became the first openly gay active player in affiliated baseball in 2015."

Because not just once, but twice during his third round, American golfer Akshay Bhatia was forced into an impromptu wardrobe change at the PGA National Resort in Palm Beach, Florida.

The first came at the sixth hole, when the 21-year-old’s tee drive settled in the muddy banks on the left of the fairway. A shirtless shot followed as Bhatia successfully scooped his ball back onto the fairway, the splashes of mud across his chest suggesting that the shirt removal was a smart decision.

A superb approach and putt saw the world No. 357 save par superbly, yet despite the best efforts of his caddie and a towel, the hole had left its mark on Bhatia. Fortunately, his girlfriend was on hand with a change of clothes, and the golfer pushed on with his round.

Bhatia had been riding the wave of an excellent second round, but effectively saw any chance of a first PGA Tour victory collapse across four holes. A run of bogey, par, double bogey and bogey saw Bhatia arrive at the par-three 15th hole needing a big response, only for his tee shot to sail over the flag and into the swampy area behind the green.

Almost knee deep in the mud, this time it was shirt and shoes off for Buhai. Unfortunately, he could not repeat his earlier escape effort, as his first attempt barely moved a yard.

Buhai eventually tapped in for another painful double bogey, later carding a four-over par 74 for the round, yet the American was cheered back to the clubhouse by fans.

“A lot of claps. Makes you feel good,” Buhai told reporters. “I feel like my body looks good, and hopefully on TV it makes it look a little bigger.

“It was amazing. This is a pretty new experience for me. Just having a lot of fans. It’s funny, [playing partner] Dylan [Frittelli] was saying, ‘Are you from here? Like how much are you paying these guys to say your name?’ And it’s just really cool because I take a lot of pride.

“It brings warmth to my heart when people are shouting my name, cheering me on. It’s really just a fun experience, and I hope to have more of it.”

A final day 69 saw Bhatia finish tied 49th, 13 shots behind champion Chris Kirk. Having secured victory on his first start as a Korn Ferry Tour member at the Bahamas Great Exuma Classic in January 2022 and making the cut on his major debut at the US Open the previous year, Bhatia already has several career highlights.

Yet his bizarre experience in Florida has him keeping his options open, according to his most recent Instagram post.

Lionel Messi and Alexia Putellas were crowned the best players in men’s and women’s football at FIFA’s annual awards ceremony in Paris on Monday.

Messi, who guided Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of last year, was honored as the Best FIFA Men’s Player for the second time in the award’s current format, while Spanish midfielder Putellas was named Best FIFA Women’s Player for the second year running.

National team coaches and captains, as well as a worldwide panel of journalists and supporters, vote on the awards each year.

The 35-year-old Messi finished ahead of Paris Saint-Germain teammate Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema in the voting for the men’s award.

“I achieved a dream I had been hoping for so long,” said Messi, reflecting on Argentina’s World Cup win. “It’s a dream for any player, very few people can achieve that and I was lucky enough to do so.”

In the World Cup final, Messi scored twice as Argentina and France played out a thrilling 3-3 draw after extra time before Argentina triumphed on penalties.

Messi also scored six goals in 26 appearances as his PSG team won a record-equaling 10th title in Ligue 1.

In his voting capacity as Argentina’s captain, Messi chose PSG teammate Neymar as the best men’s player ahead of Mbappé and Benzema.

Putellas, meanwhile, scored 34 goals in all competitions last season and captained Barcelona to a domestic treble and a spot in the Champions League final against eventual winner Lyon.

The 29-year-old, who missed the European Championships with an ACL injury, finished ahead of the USA international Alex Morgan and England striker Beth Mead in the voting.

She also becomes the first player to win the women’s award twice.

As well as Messi, two other Argentinians – goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and coach Lionel Scaloni – were honored at the awards ceremony, while England goalkeeper Mary Earps and coach Sarina Wiegman were recognized on the women’s side.

The Puskás Award for the best goal in men’s and women’s football went to Polish amputee star Marcin Oleksy for an outrageous scissor-kick goal while playing for Warta Poznan in November.

“I connected really cleanly. It was pure,” Oleksy said about his goal.

“When I hit it, I was following the ball all the way with my eyes and I saw it go into the corner of the net. I always wanted to score a beautiful goal. You could see how proud it made me after I scored. I stood up tall, I put my chest out. I was just so, so happy.”"

Getting tickets to golf’s most prestigious event is, quite literally, a lottery.

Unless you happen to share a name with a pro golfer and are accidentally sent an invite by mistake (like one Georgia realtor), for most fans the best chance to attend The Masters is to try their luck in the annual ticket lottery.

It’s a long shot to say the least, the golfing equivalent of Willy Wonka’s golden ticket. But while thousands of golf fans won’t be at Augusta National in April to see the major, they’ll still be able to taste it – for $175.

Rebooted for 2023, the “Taste of the Masters” hosting kit can be ordered to homes across the US, allowing fans to unbox a range of Augusta concessions to serve up come tee-time.

Like strawberries and cream at Wimbledon, sandwiches have become synonymous with Augusta. Famed for their prices, which haven’t changed for decades, the pimento cheese and egg salad sandwiches still retailed at $1.50 at last year’s event and have become a staple of the major.

The pricing served as a stark contrast to some of the charges at the PGA Championship the following month, with eventual winner Justin Thomas “blown away” at the $18 and $16 asking price for beer and salad respectively at the major.

Both Masters sandwich fillings come in 24-ounce tubs as part of the kit, as well as pork bar-b-que. Bread and buns are not included, but 12 bags of potato chips and 12 cookies also feature in a bundle designed to serve 12 to 14 guests.

Souvenir cups (25), wax paper (12 sheets), and coasters (12) – all emblazoned with The Masters branding – round out the kit, which promises to arrive no later than April 7, the second day of the tournament. Shipping is US only, though excludes Alaska and Hawaii.

The kit was first announced for the 2020 tournament, when, according to Covid-19 protocols, tournament organizers prepared to stage the major with limited attendance.

It was not offered in 2021 but returned for last year’s event, retailing at $150. The line-up featured the same three sandwich fillings, potato chips and cookies as 2022’s offering, with the addition of pecan caramel popcorn."

Canada Soccer president Nick Bontis announced his resignation on Monday, acknowledging “change” is required as its national team programs’ collective bargaining negotiations continue.

Bontis, who was elected to the position in November 2020, left his post in the wake of a letter from the 13 members of the provincial and territorial organizations, a group known as the Presidents Forum, requesting his resignation – citing a loss in faith of his ability to lead the organization – according to Canadian sports television network TSN.

“Canada Soccer and both of our National Team Programs have the real potential to sign a historic collective bargaining agreement. Once signed, it will be a landmark deal that will set our nation apart from virtually every other FIFA Member Association,” Bontis said in a written statement Monday.

“While I have been one of the biggest proponents of equalizing the competitive performance environment for our Women’s National Team, I will unfortunately not be leading this organization when it happens. I acknowledge that this moment requires change.”

The Canadian men’s and women’s national teams have been in negotiations for a new contract, with the women seeking equal pay relative to the men’s team.

The women’s national team has been playing what it has termed as “operating under a protest” while its pay equity dispute with the national federation remains unresolved.

Earlier this month, the Canadian Soccer Players Association, which represents the women’s team, said it would be “taking job action” and said in a statement the players are “demanding immediate change.

In the lead up to the men’s World Cup in Qatar last year, the men’s national team went on strike in June, angered over the lack of a deal for the splitting of World Cup bonuses.

At the time, the men’s players said they were, in part, seeking “an equitable structure with our women’s national team that shares the same player match fees, percentage of prize money earned at our respective FIFA World Cups and the development of a women’s domestic league,” according to a letter TSN had obtained.

Canada is one of the co-hosts of the next men’s World Cup in 2026. The women, who are preparing for the upcoming World Cup this summer, are the reigning Olympic champions."

At just 16 years old, Mia Brookes became the youngest snowboarding world champion after winning gold in the women’s slopestyle at the Snowboard, Freestyle and Freeski World Championships in Bakuriani, Georgia on Monday.

Brookes claimed her win in style – becoming the first woman to land a CAB 1440 double grab in official competition – as the British teenager also secured her country’s first snowboard slopestyle world title.

“I feel like I could cry, I’ve never been so happy in my life,” Brookes told reporters after her win.

Brookes was too young to compete at the Winter Olympics in Beijing last year but showed few nerves on the big stage.

The British teenager sat second after her first run in Bakuriani but pulled out all the stops in her second attempt.

The 16-year-old, competing in her first year on the senior circuit, performed the highly complicated CAB 1440 double grab – which involves four full rotations in the air – to earn a winning score of 91.38.

“I actually can’t believe it,” she said about landing the trick, per GB Snowsport. “When I did it, I wasn’t sure I’d managed it, but I thought about it and was like yep, I’ve done a 14!”

New Zealand’s reigning Olympic champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott took silver with a score of 88.78, while Japan’s Onitsuka Miyabi won bronze with 83.05.

“What Mia’s done out here today is just next level,” GB Snowsport head coach Pat Sharples said.

“We all know Mia’s got the talent, but this is her first season on the WC circuit and her first World championships so to land a run like that with all the pressure of a World Championships tells you everything you need to know about her.

“We’re all so stoked for Mia, her coaches Mikey and Ben, her parents Vicky and Nige, and the whole team around her.”

Exciting talent

Brookes, who is still at school, has long been considered one of the most talented youngsters in the world of winter sports.

She was just 18-months old when she first tried snowboarding, honing her skills in both the UK and on European ski trips with her parents.

However, it’s not always been plane sailing for the youngster.

In 2021, she suffered a serious concussion while snowboarding, per Team GB, and had to be airlifted off the slopes.

While admitting that she still gets a little scared when competing, the Winter Olympics in 2026 at Milan-Cortina remain a big goal in her life.

“The Olympic rings are at the end of the tunnel,” she told Team GB.

“But I take it day by day and think about what I need to improve on next. The Olympics would be quite cool.”"
