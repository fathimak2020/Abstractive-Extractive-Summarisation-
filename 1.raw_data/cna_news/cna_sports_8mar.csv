Just as they had in Germany three weeks ago when Dortmund won 1-0, 2021 champions Chelsea squandered chance after chance in the first half, with Germany's Havertz hitting the post. But in the 43rd minute Ben Chilwell crossed into the box and found England team mate Raheem Sterling.

Sterling airkicked his first effort, then sidestepped Marco Reus and sent his second high into the net to put the teams level on aggregate.

Early in the second half a Chilwell cross smacked into the outstretched hand of defender Marius Wolf and Dutch referee Danny Makkelie gave the penalty after being called to the VAR screen.Havertz hit the keeper's left hand post and play resumed for a few seconds until VAR alerted Makkelie that Dortmund players had encroached into the area. Havertz retook the kick and sent the ball the same way but this time it squeezed inside the post for a 53rd-minute strike.

It was Dortmund's first defeat following wins in their previous 10 matches and a boost for Chelsea, who have struggled for form under Graham Potter since the turn of the year."

Benfica took the lead in the 38th minute through Rafa Silva who dribbled past two defenders and fired a left foot strike into the net after a counter-attack started by Goncalo Ramos who sped up the left channel before crossing to the far post.

Ramos then scored either side of the break before Joao Mario extended the lead with a penalty in the 71st minute.

Substitute David Neres grabbed the fifth six minutes later before Bjorn Meijer got a consolation Brugge in the 87th."

The Italians beat Spurs 1-0 at San Siro last month but suffered a Serie A setback as their four-game winning streak in all competitions ended with Saturday's 2-1 loss at Fiorentina.

""This is a different story compared to Florence, but also compared to the first leg,"" Pioli told a news conference on Tuesday. ""I expect a different attitude from them... Tottenham will probably try to attack more than at San Siro.""

The visitors have been boosted as forward Brahim Diaz and striker Olivier Giroud will both be available for the clash after they rejoined the team in training on Tuesday.

""They're both doing well, all 24 players can play from the start, then I'll make the choices,"" Pioli said.

Both players were a doubt for the London trip after Diaz missed the game at Fiorentina with a knee problem while Giroud did not train on Monday due to flu, Italian media reported.

Tottenham's Italian boss Antonio Conte will be back on the touchline on Wednesday after gallbladder surgery kept him out of action for a month, which will help Spurs according to Pioli.

""The presence of the coach is important, I speak from personal experience. Conte is an added value and beyond him we will find a very motivated opponent,"" he said.

""Tomorrow is the match of personalities. Our opponents are formidable from an offensive point of view.

""They will play with great intensity and we must be prepared to control the game more. We have a very small advantage but we cannot think of managing it,"" he added."

The Canadian finished sixth in Sunday's Bahrain opener despite injuries that included also a broken right big toe in the training fall in Spain on Feb 18.

""My medical team, at first, believed I was not only going to miss testing, but realistically the first few races,"" Stroll told followers on Instagram.

The 24-year-old said he had surgery on his right wrist 48 hours after the accident and 12 days before the first race, with the operation carried out by MotoGP traumatology specialist Javier Mir in Barcelona.

""Following surgery, Dr Mir told me I’d be back for Jeddah if I worked hard and with a bit of luck he was optimistic I could race in Bahrain - but that was a faint possibility,"" said Stroll.

""To this day I am convinced the urgency Dr Mir showed to me helped get me to Bahrain.""

Stroll said Mir also explained that fractures in his left wrist and hand could not be fixed and needed ""a more conservative approach"".

""My medical team ensured we were doing anything and everything that showed some evidence for bone healing. It became my full time job, trying to combine everything that could help, even if it was by 0.5 per cent,"" he said.

""Once the cast came off on day four it became possible we had a chance of racing in Bahrain. My medical team devised a programme that would help me restore mobility and strength in my wrists.""

Stroll's Spanish team mate Fernando Alonso finished third in the opening race, with the Canadian's points lifting the team to second overall.

The next race is in Saudi Arabia on Mar 19."

Bilic took over at Vicarage Road in September with the club sitting 10th in the Championship.

He and his coaching staff leave the former Premier League club in ninth place but four points off the playoff places and with just one win in their last eight league matches.

""We are all ambitious to succeed this season, so something new is needed quickly while the opportunity of promotion is still real,"" Watford technical director Ben Manga told the club website.

""With the January transfer window over, to change coach is the only option available to re-energise for the final games ahead.""

Bilic previously managed West Ham United and West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League and is the 18th permanent Watford manager to lose his job since the Italian Pozzo family took over the club in 2012.

Wilder, 55, helped Sheffield United gain promotion from third-tier League One to the Championship and then finally to the Premier League in three years. He was most recently manager at Middlesbrough."

The final was delayed by 36 minutes after thousands of Liverpool supporters were unable to get into the Stade de France for the match on May 28, which Real Madrid won 1-0.

French police were filmed using tear gas on fans, including women and children. Although UEFA initially blamed the Merseyside club's fans for the mayhem, the governing body later apologised following the release of an independent review.

""We have taken into account a huge number of views expressed both publicly and privately and we believe we have devised a scheme that is comprehensive and fair,"" UEFA General Secretary Theodore Theodoridis said in statement.

""We value the input from the Liverpool FC supporter organisations Spirit of Shankly (SOS) and Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association (LDSA) as well as the open and transparent dialogue throughout this period.

""We recognise the negative experiences of those supporters on the day and with this scheme we will refund fans who had bought tickets and who were the most affected by the difficulties in accessing the stadium.""

UEFA said refunds would be available to all fans with tickets for gates A, B, C, X, Y and Z which was where ""the most difficult circumstances were reported"". Liverpool fans had 19,618 tickets allocated for the final.

The two fan groups, SOS and LDSA, welcomed the announcement with a joint statement but said it does not let UEFA off the hook.

""With a promise to reimburse supporters, UEFA have gone some way to acknowledge their part in the fiasco,"" they said.

""But it does not excuse UEFA, exempt them from criticism or lessen the need for them to implement all of the recommendations made by the independent inquiry.""

Tickets for the final cost between £62 (US$74) to £610 (US$733).

""In addition, all fans who according to the access control data did not enter the stadium before 21:00 CET (the originally scheduled kick-off time) or who were not able to enter the stadium at all, will be eligible for a refund,"" UEFA added.

""Due to the nature of the original ticket sales process, whereby Liverpool fans purchased tickets from Liverpool FC and not directly from UEFA, UEFA has requested that the club implements the refunds to ensure personal data protection and for ease of process.""

UEFA said Real Madrid fans and neutral supporters who meet the refund criteria will be processed via their customer service."
9,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/ferrari-put-reliability-top-do-list-3331336,"Reliability was not the top concern for new Ferrari boss Fred Vasseur before the start of the Formula One season but Sunday's (Mar 5) opening race in Bahrain sent it back up the list of priorities.

Charles Leclerc, who led a Ferrari one-two from pole at Sakhir last year, lost power and retired 17 laps from the end while Carlos Sainz finished fourth.

Ferrari had already changed the energy store on Leclerc's car before the race, a blow with drivers having only two for the 23-race season without a grid penalty.

Until then both drivers had been more focused on whether their car could match the speed of Red Bull, who suffered a double retirement last year but this time cruised to a one-two finish with Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez.

""Overall I would say the picture is not the one expected before the race,"" Vasseur told reporters.

""It's the first time we had it (the problem) and we didn't face the same issue at all during the 6,000-7,000km that we did with the engines in the last week with the three teams.

""We never had the same issue on the dyno throughout the winter,"" he added.

""The most important now is to have a clear picture of the situation, where we are failing and do a proper analysis on this and to come back stronger as soon as possible.""

The Frenchman felt Ferrari were matching Red Bull in qualifying but needed to fix reliability and tyre degradation in the race.

Both Ferrari drivers suffered heavy tyre wear and while Leclerc was third before the failure, Sainz finished 48 seconds behind Verstappen.

Red Bull dominated on a soft/soft/hard tyre strategy while Ferrari had to go for soft/hard/hard.

""The fact they are able to do two soft and one hard (stints) when we have to do two hard one soft for sure is a game killer,"" said Vasseur.

""We have to improve on this but I would say that the first issue for me is the reliability because we need to have zero issues.""

Vasseur was confident Ferrari were on the right track and could be a match for Red Bull, even if rivals Mercedes are already rethinking their car's design given the gap they face.

""I never saw a car able to match the pace of another one in quali and to not be able to in the race,"" said Vasseur. ""Then it's a matter of set-up and some choices on the car. It's not a matter of concept at all.""

Ferrari won two of the first three races last year before fading due to poor reliability, strategy blunders and driver mistakes.

Vasseur arrived from Swiss-based Sauber in January to replace the departed Mattia Binotto and has made some immediate changes, including a strategy shake-up.

The team sacrificed a potential pole on Saturday to give Leclerc a set of new soft tyres for the race and Sunday's pitstops went without a hitch."

Conte underwent emergency surgery but made a quick return to the dugout last month before doctors advised him to rest and recover again as he watched Spurs games from home while his assistant Cristian Stellini took charge of the team.

The Italian said he wanted to return early after Spurs were knocked out of the FA Cup by Sheffield United last week but he respected the wishes of worried doctors who had put their foot down and asked him to return only on Sunday.

""For sure I under-evaluated the recovery after surgery. For this reason I think that for my sense of responsibility I wanted to come back early,"" Conte told reporters on Tuesday (Mar 7), a day before Milan visit looking to defend their 1-0 lead from the last 16 first leg.

""Maybe I over-evaluated my body and myself. Now I'm well, I've recovered energy and I have to recover weight but for the rest my feeling is good. I try to transfer my energy to my players, it's an important game for us.

""It's important for me to work with my players and the staff and prepare for the games. From afar I tried to stay very close with my players using video. To be present is totally different and for this reason I have to say thanks to my whole staff.""

Spurs forward Son Heung-min said he was glad to have Conte back as his energy was infectious.

""He brings good energy to the team. When the boss isn't here it's different,"" Son said.

""Yesterday we could feel that energy and his passion. If he's on the touchline, the players will be more comfortable and will give us an amazing boost.""

Spurs are fourth in the league and the success of their season could hinge on going through to the next round of the Champions League, with Conte saying they have to cope with ""living with pressure"" and using it in a positive way.

""We live for these moments because when the pressure is going up it means your level is going up,"" Conte said.

""Don't forget that last season we were playing in the Conference League. This season we're playing in the Champions League.

""If you ask me if I want to win the Champions League I would say yes, but then there is the reality. We have to go game by game."""
11,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/fifa-us-soccer-must-face-antitrust-lawsuit-us-appeals-court-3332061,"NEW YORK :A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday revived an antitrust lawsuit accusing FIFA and the U.S. Soccer Federation of illegally banning foreign clubs and leagues from staging official matches in the United States.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Relevent Sports LLC, a sports promoter controlled by billionaire Miami Dolphins American football team owner Stephen Ross, plausibly alleged that the October 2018 ban unlawfully restricted competition.

""Adoption of the policy, combined with the member leagues' prior agreement, by joining FIFA, to adhere to its policies, constitutes an agreement on the part of all-whether they voted in favor of the policy or not-to adhere to the announced restriction on competition,"" Circuit Judge Raymond Lohier wrote.

The 3-0 decision raises the prospect that U.S. stadiums could eventually host regular season matches between foreign teams, which could compete for fans and sponsors now supporting FIFA-affiliated Major League Soccer.

Some European and South American teams play ""friendly"" matches in the United States, but not regular season matches.

FIFA, soccer's world governing body with 211 member associations, announced its foreign match policy after Relevent arranged with Spain's La Liga to host a regular season match between FC Barcelona and Girona FC in Miami.

Barcelona eventually withdrew, and Relevent sued after U.S. Soccer refused to sanction a May 2019 match in Miami between two Ecuadorean teams.

Relevent, based in New York, also operates the International Champions Cup.

In July 2021, U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni found no proof of an illegal conspiracy to ban foreign matches.

She also said U.S. Soccer had good reasons to honor the ban, including the risk FIFA might exclude U.S. men from the World Cup.

Tuesday's decision overturned that ruling, and returned the case to Caproni.

FIFA said it will review the decision. U.S. Soccer and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In an email, Relevent's lawyer Jeffrey Kessler said the company looked forward to pursuing its claims ""to vindicate the ability of U.S. soccer fans to enjoy live play of some of the best soccer teams in the world.""

The case is Relevent Sports LLC v U.S. Soccer Federation Inc et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-2088."
12,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/pitch-intrigue-adds-drama-ahead-ahmedabad-finale-3333761,"AHMEDABAD, India : Pitch talk has been a constant feature of India's four-test series against Australia and the trend continued on the eve of the final match in Ahmedabad which is likely to draw a record crowd on Thursday.

After rank turners were rolled out for the first three matches of the series, curiosity abounded about the possible nature of the surface in Ahmedabad.

With the groundstaff yet to confirm which of the two prepared pitches would be used, Australia's stand-in captain Steve Smith decided to delay naming their playing XI.

""We'll have a look (at the pitch on Wednesday) and we'll reassess, but it could be we name the team at the toss,"" Smith told reporters on Wednesday.

Smith will lead Australia again in the absence of regular skipper Pat Cummins who flew home after the second match in Delhi to be with his ailing mother in Sydney.

India retained the Border-Gavaskar trophy with back-to-back wins in Nagpur and Delhi but Smith says drawing the series would be no mean feat for his side.

""It'd be a huge achievement for the group, or any touring team that comes here to India and wins two test matches,"" Smith said.

The largest attendance for a single day of test cricket is 91,112 - a record set during the fourth game between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the 2013-14 Ashes series.

That could be shattered on Thursday when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after whom the 132,000 capacity stadium in Ahmedabad is named, welcomes his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese.

India, who are 2-1 ahead in the series, would need to win the match to seal their place in the final of the World Test Championship in June against Australia.

Skipper Rohit Sharma played down pitch talks and said the team with better skills would prevail.

""How challenging the pitches are, how much is it turning, how much is it seaming...we are trying to keep all of that away,"" Rohit told reporters.

""Conditions are there for us to play and you got to find your ways to score your runs on whatever pitches you play on.""

Spinners have ruled the roost in the series, especially in the third test in Indore where India suffered two collapses en route to a nine-wicket loss.

""Not putting enough runs on the board in the first innings is probably what cost us the game,"" Rohit said.

""It tells you that toss is not a factor at all in this series.

""You got bring out your best skills and play your best cricket to win the game."""
14,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/floridas-desantis-urges-biden-let-unvaccinated-djokovic-enter-us-miami-open-3333531,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has called on U.S. President Joe Biden to allow Novak Djokovic to compete at this month's Miami Open despite the world number one being unvaccinated for COVID-19.

Djokovic, one of the most high-profile athletes unvaccinated against the virus, applied to the U.S. government last month for special permission to play at ATP Masters events Indian Wells, which begins on Wednesday, and the March 19-April 2 Miami Open.

The Serbian, 35, formally withdrew from Indian Wells on Sunday. Florida Senator Rick Scott said that U.S. officials had denied Djokovic's request.

""This denial is unfair, unscientific and unacceptable,"" DeSantis wrote in a letter to Biden on Tuesday.

""I urge you to reconsider. It's time to put pandemic politics aside and give the American people what they want - let him play.""

Republican DeSantis signed a law in November 2021 banning schools, businesses and government entities from requiring vaccination against COVID-19, drawing condemnation from health experts and Democratic leaders.

The U.S. currently bars unvaccinated foreigners from entry into the country, a policy that is expected to be lifted when the government ends its COVID-19 emergency declarations on May 11.

Djokovic, who missed last year's Australian Open after being deported from that country due to his vaccination status, has said he would skip Grand Slams rather than have a COVID shot.

He won his record-tying 22nd Grand Slam at the Australian Open in January. He has not played at Indian Wells or the Miami Open - which together comprise the ""Sunshine Double"" - since 2019.

Last week, Scott and fellow Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida also wrote to Biden urging him to grant the waiver request.

Indian Wells tournament director Tommy Haas, the United States Tennis Association and the U.S. Open were among those also hoping Djokovic would be allowed to enter.

""The only thing keeping Mr Djokovic from participating in this tournament is your administration's continued enforcement of a misguided, unscientific, and out-of-date COVID-19 vaccination requirement for foreign guests,"" DeSantis said."

Wales players had threatened not to play against England last month to protest contract and other issues, but the strike was averted and the game went ahead as scheduled, with Wales suffering their third successive defeat at the tournament.

Wales remain at the bottom of the Six Nations standings without a point. They play away against Italy on Saturday.

""It is just unfortunate, and the situation we are all in at the moment is not great for anyone involved,"" number eight Faletau told British media on Tuesday. ""It's just a tough time we are stuck in at the moment.""

Welsh rugby remains challenged by financial problems as a deal between the governing WRU, Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets has yet to be agreed upon.

Those professional regions are facing major funding cuts that could lead to heavily-reduced contract offers for many players whose deals expire at the end of the season, while an exodus of players to clubs abroad is also a possibility.

""You are always going to try to put your best foot forward, but when things aren't going well off the pitch it's hard to give your all then,"" Faletau said."

A full-fledged WPL kicked off on Saturday, 15 years after the launch of the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) for men, and Healy leads UP Warriorz in the five-team tournament.

The WPL is expected to be a game changer for the women's game after several female cricketers experienced the biggest payday of their careers at the auction, where teams had $1.45 million each to spend on acquiring players.

Reflecting Australia's dominance in women's cricket, Healy said the WBBL, an eight-team competition in Australia, would need to ensure it is lucrative enough to attract the best players.

""The WBBL has been the envy of women's cricket for eight years now, but there's no denying the WPL will put pressure on our domestic competition,"" Healy wrote in her column on Cricket Australia's website on Wednesday.

""It's not all about money, but players in the WPL are earning more for a three-week competition than they are playing for their country for 12 months of the year.

""For the WBBL to keep pace with the WPL and retain its status as the best domestic competition in the world, we need to make sure it's lucrative and exciting enough for the best players to keep making the trip to Australia.""

Healy added that Australia needed to start considering franchise cricket as an ""entertainment proposition"".

""I feel strongly that the WBBL should be about entertainment: our showpiece competition where fans pack out the hill and watch the best players in the world do battle,"" Healy said."

Former Germany coach Klinsmann, 58, has signed a contract until the 2026 World Cup and succeeds Paulo Bento, who stepped down in December after South Korea's World Cup round of 16 defeat by Brazil in Qatar.

South Korea were the inaugural Asian Cup champions in 1956 and last won the competition when they retained the trophy as hosts in 1960. They have already qualified for the 2023 tournament in Qatar, which has been delayed until January.

""Our goal is to win the Asian Cup next year,"" Klinsmann told reporters, reeling off the names of previous South Korea coaches and their recent successes.

""When you have a team and a history for the last 20-25 years here that was built by coaches like Guus Hiddink, Uli Stielike, Paulo Bento, I think the goal has to be winning the Asian Cup,"" he said.

Dutch coach Hiddink led South Korea to the 2002 World Cup semi-finals. In December under Portuguese coach Bento, they stunned Portugal en route to reaching the final 16. South Korea also dumped former champions Germany out of the group stages in the 2018 World Cup.

""Winning is the goal because you proved in Qatar and you beat big nations, you beat Portugal in Qatar and four years ago you beat Germany so you can do very well,"" Klinsmann said.

""When this opportunity came up and we had to talk, I was very excited because I think it's a very good team.""

Klinsmann, who was announced as Bento's replacement last month, won the 1990 World Cup as a player and coached his native Germany to the semi-finals of the 2006 tournament.

He also managed his former club Bayern Munich before taking over as head coach of the U.S. national team from 2011-16. His last coaching role was a 10-week stint in charge of Bundesliga side Hertha Berlin in 2020.

Klinsmann's first match as South Korea's coach will be a home friendly against Colombia on March 24."

The Hurricanes skipper drew his thumb across his throat as he exchanged words with Melbourne Rebels scrumhalf Ryan Louwrens during their Super Rugby match last weekend.

Loose forward Savea was sanctioned by a judicial panel on Tuesday for going ""against the spirit of good sportsmanship"".

""He accepted it pretty much straight away. When he was sitting in the sin bin for 10 minutes (he knew) it was something he shouldn’t have done,"" Hurricanes coach Jason Holland told New Zealand media.

""I’m aligned with him on that and to get the one-week sanction is the way it is and we accept it.

""Ardie was sorry and we just have to get on with accepting that and get on with what comes next.""

Savea's loss is a big blow for the undefeated Hurricanes who host last year's runnersup, the Auckland Blues, at home on Saturday.

Savea was instrumental in the 39-33 win over the Rebels in Melbourne, scoring two tries and setting up another for Josh Moorby before he was yellow-carded for his involvement in a melee.

Holland said he was not sure what led to Savea making the threatening gesture at Louwrens as he walked off to the sin bin.

""I don’t think there was any one thing - it was just a combination of how everything unfolded there with people running in from both sides and a bit of adrenaline going but as we’ve said, there’s no excuse for where we got to at the end of it,"" added Holland.

Dortmund won the first leg at home 1-0 but a first-half goal by Raheem Sterling and a controversial penalty by Havertz handed them a 2-0 defeat in the second leg at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday as they crashed out of the last 16 2-1 on aggregate.

Chelsea were given a penalty in the second half after a cross from Ben Chilwell smacked into the outstretched hand of Dortmund defender Marius Wolf.

Havertz hit the post from the spot but the penalty was re-taken after VAR alerted the referee that Dortmund players had encroached into the area. In his second try, Havertz went on to score, sending Chelsea into the quarter-finals.

""I'm not sure what more he can do with his hand,"" Bellingham told BT Sport, referring to Wolf. ""That in itself was disappointing and the fact that they've had a retake, I think it's a joke.

""For every penalty, especially when you have such a slow run-up, there's going to be people encroaching into the box by a yard or so. He has made the decision and we have to live with it.""

Dortmund coach Edin Terzic said his team would refrain from complaining.

""If a decision takes about five or six minutes then it's not easy to make a call,"" Terzic said.

""But as the manager of the team, I'm responsible for the performance of the team and staff, but not the performance of the referee. We didn't speak about the referee a lot last week and we won't start with that tonight."""

Hamilton had been considered the frontrunner and preferred candidate to stage the centennial Games but was unable to obtain the required government backing by Commonwealth Sport Canada's February deadline.

The Hamilton100 bid proposed an operating budget of around C$1 billion CDN ($727 million), with the private sector kicking in between $250 million to $500 million.

""Commonwealth Sport Canada set an early deadline for provincial financial support and the province simply didn’t have sufficient time to make a commitment,"" Hamilton100 bid chief Louis Frapporti told Reuters on Tuesday.

""As a consequence Commonwealth Sport Canada jumped to Alberta, where they were prepared to make an early commitment to support the funding of bid preparation.

""It’s anyone’s guess whether they can finalise and submit a bid.

""Our provincial stakeholders remain interested in advancing a bid in the event that Alberta doesn’t get it across the line.""

Commonwealth Sport Canada and the Alberta 2030 Commonwealth Games Corporation have scheduled a press conference for Wednesday in Calgary to officially launch the exploration process.

Calgary hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics but saw hopes of bringing the 2026 Winter Games back to the western Canadian city dashed when citizens voted resoundingly against a bid.

Edmonton hosted the 1978 Commonwealth Games.

If Canada does not put forward a bid it would be another blow for the quadrennial event.

Chelsea fans, many of whom had booed Potter loudly when defeat followed defeat in recent weeks, cheered the team off the pitch after a goal by Raheem Sterling and a re-taken penalty by Kai Havertz earned the Blues a 2-0 win on the night.

That turned a 1-0 deficit in the first leg in Germany into a ticket for the quarter finals and kicked off celebrations that harked back to some of Chelsea's great nights in Europe's top competition over the past 20 years.

For Potter, the victory was personal too.

""Inevitably in life, you are going to have bad times and you're going to have good times,"" Potter told reporters when asked about how he felt after shouldering much of the blame for Chelsea's bleak run of form that began as far back as October.

""Things are never bad forever, thankfully. But it felt like that sometimes,"" he said.

Potter confirmed he had a quick post-match meeting with Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly who had been all smiles in the stands, wrapped in a blue and white scarf.

""I'm still here,"" Potter said about the outcome of the meeting, shrugging off with a laugh the speculation that his job was on the line depending on the result of Tuesday's match.

It was the biggest win yet for Chelsea's new owners who paid 4.25 billion pounds ($5.03 billion) last year for the 2021 European champions.

Since then, the consortium has invested more than 500 million pounds in new players, continuing the kind of lavish spending seen under the former owner of Stamford Bridge, Russian tycoon Roman Abramovich, who was forced to relinquish the club after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.

Until Tuesday's win, Boehly and the rest of the consortium had seen little return on their investment.

Chelsea have slumped to 10th place in the English Premier League, with their chances of reaching next season's Champions League via a top-four finish all but gone, and the team were eliminated early in both of England's knockout cup competitions.

The Blues struggled even to score during a miserable run of two wins in 15 games that was only ended last Saturday with a close-run 1-0 victory over struggling Leeds United.

Potter, who had to fill the big shoes of Champions League winner Thomas Tuchel when the German was fired last September, again told reporters after Tuesday's win that his job had been made harder by a long list of injuries in late 2022.

But the former Brighton & Hove Albion coach went out of his way to praise Chelsea fans, saying he understood their frustrations and appreciated the atmosphere they created in Stamford Bridge against Dortmund.

""Big thanks to the supporters. They were amazing tonight, they helped us on Saturday and they helped us this evening,"" Potter said. ""So it's brilliant for everyone connected with the club.""

30,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/time-more-women-uefas-top-table-says-norways-klaveness-3332711,"STOCKHOLM : The time has come for more women at the highest level in football and not just representing the women's game, Norwegian Football Association (NFF) president and UEFA executive committee candidate Lise Klaveness told Reuters.

The 41-year-old former Norway international said that she did not want to be appointed to the highest committee of European soccer's governing body, known as ExCo, and instead is aiming to break new ground by being elected by the other national associations.

""I'm the first female president to ever run for an ExCo election, which is pretty critical when you consider that it's the biggest sport for girls and women in the world, so we need a board that reflects that,"" she said in a telephone interview.

Part of the Norway team that finished fourth at the World Cup in China in 2007, Klaveness played 73 times for her country and served as Norway's technical director before being elected NFF president a year ago.

""Men's football is just as close to my heart as women's football, I find that technical competence has to be represented in the boardrooms, alongside business skills and entertainment skills and investment skills, but the technical aspect needs to be very well-represented, and I'm ready to do that,"" she said.

Having climbed to the highest post in her country's football association, Klaveness is looking for broader female representation across the board.

""I am for a system where you're elected because of merit, so the reason why I talk about female representation is that I think it's a very important thing for football structures,"" she explained when asked why other nations should vote for her.

GOOD INSIGHT

""I will be ready to do a good job in the ExCo because I have good insight to the game - I've spent my life in football, both on the women's and the men's side,"" she said.

""I was the first female to ever commentate on the men's game in Norway, on the World Cup and Premier League, and then the first technical director to lead the men's national team, and now the first female president.""

A qualified lawyer specialising in employment law, Klaveness gave a fiery speech at FIFA's congress in Doha in March last year, urging delegates to consider the situation of migrant workers and LGBT people ahead of the World Cup in Qatar, which took place in November and December.

While she says she has seen progress in football in terms of equality over the last two decades, the former midfielder said there is still work to be done.

""I definitely see the progress and it inspires me, but it does not change that, on some level, it's going the opposite direction - for example, gaps increasing between bonus payments between the men and women,"" she said.

The elections to UEFA's executive committee will take place at the governing body's congress in early April, and Klaveness is hoping that its members will be ready to give their votes to a female candidate.

""I think it's time, and it's an important step ... I think that, if we want diversity down the (football) pyramid, we need to walk the walk at the top level,"" she said.

32,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/ukraines-ryzhykova-fighting-best-way-she-can-track-3332701,"Hurdler Anna Ryzhykova, one of an estimated 40,000 athletes across all sports forced to flee Ukraine to train abroad after Russia's invasion, says she is fighting for her homeland in the best way she can - with her results on the track.

The Olympic bronze medallist has already qualified for the World Athletics Championships in August and the renewal of the Ukraine Solidarity Fund, announced by the sport's global governing body on Wednesday, will help ease her road there.

The World Athletics backed fund distributed $220,000 to more than 100 Ukraine athletes in 2022.

Ryzhykova fled her eastern Ukraine home of Dnipro within weeks of Russia invading the country in February last year in what Moscow calls a ""special operation."" Her coach Volodymyr Kravchenko joined Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces.

""Every Ukrainian stood up to defend our homeland ... as is the case in sport,"" Ryzhykova told a small group of reporters on a call from Fort Worth, Texas, where she is temporarily living and training. ""By participating in competitions, we do not let the world forget about such a country as Ukraine.

""I continue to cry and worry every day about my friends, my family. But I still continue to train and still continue to show good results to help my country.""

The 33-year-old Ryzhykova was fifth in the 400 metres hurdles at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and won bronze at the 2012 London Olympics in the 4x400 relay.

FACILITIES DESTROYED

According to international athlete-led organisation Global Athlete, since the invasion 343 sport facilities have been destroyed, leaving an estimated 140,000 young athletes without facilities, while 40,000 athletes are training abroad.

The figures cover all sports.

Ryzhykova spent many weeks each year training at a top athletics facility in Bakhmut.

Russian forces have been waging an intense campaign for months to seize control of the small city and secure Moscow its first battlefield victory in more than half a year.

""Now it is destroyed, and the city is under fire for the last many months,"" said Ryzhykova.

The financial help to train and compete abroad is crucial since ""sports bases have been destroyed, there are constant threats of rocket attacks, we live in fear,"" she added.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last month that 228 Ukrainian athletes had been killed in the war.

RUSSIAN STRIKE

Ukraine's high jumper Kateryna Tabashnyk dedicated her bronze medal at this month's European Indoor Championships to her mother, who was killed in a Russian strike in August, saying: ""This medal carries all my pain and sorrow.""

Ryzhykova, who also fears children will never know the joy of sports having lived so much of their young lives in bomb shelters, said she hopes no one ever feels her sense of despair.

""You forget about your career, about your dreams and you think about how to survive and how to help your family and friends to survive, and the World Athletics Solidarity Fund really saved our athletes' careers, and gave us a chance to fight for our country in our own way,"" she said.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is facing a major backlash after opening the door for athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete at next year's Paris Olympics.

Belarus has been a key staging area for Russia's invasion.

""They're killing my friends, my friends' relatives, many of my friends go to war, also a number of athletes were killed by Russians,"" Ryzhykova said. ""I can't even imagine how to be near the person who supports the war or keeps silent.""

Ryzhykova added that she would support a Ukraine boycott of the Paris Games, but hopes the IOC bans Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing there instead.

The Russian Athletics Federation (RAF) has been banned from athletics since 2015 as a result of the country's widespread doping, although some athletes from Russia were allowed to compete at the last two Summer Olympics as neutrals."
34,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/world-athletics-renews-funding-ukrainian-athletes-3332706,"World Athletics will once again help fund Ukrainian athletes' as they prepare for the Aug. 19 to 27 World Athletics Championships in Budapest, the sport's global governing body said on Tuesday.

World Athletics announced it was renewing the Ukraine Solidarity Fund, plus several steps planned towards achieving gender equity as part of its #WeGrowAthletics campaign in celebration of Wednesday's International Women's Day.

World Athletics distributed over $220,000 to more than 100 Ukrainian athletes in 2022. Female athletes, including hurdler Anna Ryzhykova, comprised 70 per cent of fund beneficiaries.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year in what Moscow calls a ""special operation"" since when 343 sport facilities have been destroyed, leaving an estimated 140,000 young athletes without facilities, while 40,000 athletes are training abroad.

The international athlete-led organisation Global Athlete provided the figures which cover all sports in Ukraine.

""I hope no one ever feels this despair,"" said Ryzhykova, who was fifth in the 400 metres hurdles at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and won Olympic bronze in the 4x400 relay in 2012 in London.

""You forget about your career, about your dreams and you think about how to survive and how to help your family and friends to survive, and the World Athletics Solidarity Fund really saved our athletes' careers, and gave us a chance to fight for our country in our own way.""

Ryzhykova is a member of World Athletics' athletes commission and has pledged to run for a WA administrative position in the future.

Among its steps toward gender equity, World Athletics is set to have 40 per cent female participation and at least one female vice-president on the World Athletics Council this year.

It is targeting 40 per cent female participation in online courses as part of a learning pipeline for future administrators.

World Athletics also plans to expand research into representation of female athletes across media channels.

And it has set a deadline of the end of 2023 for all 214 global member federations to implement safeguarding policies.

World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said gender equity was an important part of reforms introduced in 2016.

""In today's world, it is not enough to provide equal opportunity, we must provide equity,"" he said in a statement.

""In order to achieve true equity in our sport, it is important that we offer our female athletes, administrators, and officials the tools and environment they need to be empowered to pursue careers at all levels of athletics."""
