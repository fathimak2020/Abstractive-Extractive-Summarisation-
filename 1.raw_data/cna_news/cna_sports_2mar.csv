The hosts were initially frustrated by their struggling visitors but goals by Bukayo Saka and Martinelli shortly before halftime put them in command as they took maximum advantage of their game in hand over Manchester City.

Captain Martin Odegaard made it 3-0 with a close-range finish in the 71st minute before Brazilian Martinelli grabbed his second to complete the rout.

A third victory in succession since losing at home to City lifted Mikel Arteta's side to 60 points from 25 games with champions City on 55.

Everton, who now have only one victory from their last 27 league visits to Arsenal, had actually looked capable of taking something from the game. But once they fell behind a 14th league defeat of the season was almost a formality.

They remained third from bottom with 21 points having played a game more than all the teams around them.

While Everton are haunted by the looming prospect of a first relegation from the Premier League, Arsenal are beginning to envisage a first title since 2004, although they still have to visit Manchester City in April.

""I am delighted with the win and the way we played after the first 25 minutes. We had some difficulties at the start,"" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said.

""Once we scored the first goal, the game unlocked. We needed a magic moment and Bukayo produced that. After that we grew and deserved to win the game.

""We played really well in the second half and could have scored more.""

Everton stunned Arsenal 1-0 in Sean Dyche's first game in charge in early February and for 40 minutes they did an extremely effective job at nullifying them again.

But with halftime looming they caved in.

Dangerman Saka had been relatively quiet but he burst into life to make the breakthrough.

Given far too much time to turn after receiving a pass from Odegaard on the right edge of the penalty area, he smashed an angled shot into the roof of the net.

Everton's Idrissa Gueye gifted Arsenal a second on the stroke of halftime. The Senegalese midfielder was caught napping by Saka who nicked the ball away from him before poking a pass to Martinelli who slipped his shot past Jordan Pickford.

The visitors thought they had been spared by an offside flag but a VAR decision overturned it and Arsenal went in at halftime to chants of ""we are top of the league"" from the home fans.

With only 17 league goals all season it looked a tall order for shot-shy Everton to salvage anything and they offered next to nothing after the break.

Odegaard fired in his side's third from Leandro Trossard's cut back and Martinelli confirmed the gulf between the sides late on by tapping in from Eddie Nketiah's assist."
2,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/liverpool-beat-wolves-english-premier-league-3317011,"LIVERPOOL: Virgil van Dijk and forward Mohamed Salah scored second-half goals as Liverpool battled to a 2-0 Premier League home win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on Wednesday (Mar 1) to boost their hopes of European football next season.

Liverpool climbed into sixth spot in the table on 39 points, ahead of Fulham on goal difference and with a game in hand, but the home side were forced to work hard on a rainy night at Anfield.

""We controlled the game without creating massively, but we found our rhythm back,"" Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp said in a TV interview as his side claimed their third win in an unbeaten four-game Premier League run.

Despite fashioning the first effort on goal in the game, the visitors suffered an early blow when left back Hugo Bueno went down clutching his hamstring midway through the first half and was replaced by Rayan Ait-Nouri.

The best chances of the opening 45 minutes fell to teenaged Liverpool midfielder Harvey Elliott, who steered a header just wide in the 39th minute and followed that up with a bouncing stoppage-time shot that was turned away for a corner.

The 19-year-old was in the thick of things again 10 minutes into the second half, controlling a firm pass from Darwin Nunez and firing another shot goalwards, but again it lacked the necessary power and precision and was easily saved by Jose Sa.

Nunez had the ball in the net for the home side in the 66th minute after a surging run by Diogo Jota, but the Portuguese striker was deemed to have fouled Max Kilman in the build-up after a VAR review and the goal was chalked off.

Van Dijk finally broke the deadlock in the 73rd minute, forcing a save with his initial header from a set-piece, before Jota put the rebound back across the goal for the Dutchman to head home from close range.

Four minutes later Salah used his right thigh to steer home a cross from Kostas Tsimikas to double his side's advantage and take the wind out of the visitors' sails as Liverpool cruised to victory, much to the delight of the home fans.

""You have to break an opponent down step by step, it's not often they make mistakes and you get easy goals in the 420 or something games I've had here,"" Klopp said.

His side now face a resurgent Manchester United, who are 10 points ahead of Liverpool in third spot, on Sunday.

""It's a big game anyway, against a team in form. We have to be ready, and we will give them a big fight,"" Klopp said."

Bryant, the couple's teenage daughter Gianna, and seven others died when their chopper smashed into a hillside near Los Angeles in January 2020.

Sheriff's deputies and firefighters who rushed to the scene snapped pictures of the carnage, including the mangled remains of the Los Angeles Lakers legend and his daughter.

Bryant's widow Vanessa sued for emotional damages over the pictures, which she feared would one day surface on the Internet.

Los Angeles County has now agreed to pay US$28.85 million to settle all crash-related litigation.

""Today marks the successful culmination of Mrs Bryant's courageous battle to hold accountable those who engaged in this grotesque conduct,"" Vanessa Bryant's attorney Luis Li said in a statement.

""She fought for her husband, her daughter, and all those in the community whose deceased family were treated with similar disrespect. We hope her victory at trial and this settlement will put an end to this practice.""

Mira Hashmall, who represented Los Angeles County in the case, called the settlement ""fair and reasonable"".

""The US$28,850,000 settlement includes the verdict awarded by the federal jury in August 2022, and further resolves all outstanding issues related to pending legal claims in state court, future claims by the Bryant children, and other costs, with each party responsible for its respective attorneys' fees,"" she said Tuesday (Feb 28).

""This settlement now concludes all County-related litigation related to the tragic January 2020 helicopter crash. We hope Ms. Bryant and her children continue to heal from their loss.""

The trial had heard how some of the first responders to the crash showed the photographs to members of the public including a bartender, while one sheriff's deputy texted them to a friend as the pair played the ""Call of Duty"" video game.

A tearful Vanessa Bryant told the trial she lives in fear of the pictures surfacing on the Internet, and ""constantly being spread"".

""Once it's spread, you can't get it back,"" she said.

She told jurors she had bolted out of the house to find a place to cry away from her daughters when she learned of the existence of the photos.

""I broke down and cried, and I wanted to run down the block and just scream,"" she said.

""I don't want my children to ever come across them.""

Chris Chester, whose wife and daughter also died in the crash, separately settled for nearly US$20 million, US media reported.

The existence of the photographs was uncovered by the Los Angeles Times a month after the crash.

In 2007, an inquiry was launched over concerns that entertainment blogs and tabloids were offering cash to law enforcement officials for inside information on accidents and arrests.

That came after TMZ published an inside account of Mel Gibson's now-infamous anti-Semitic rant during his arrest in Malibu."

A day after being taken to three sets by Czech qualifier Tomas Machac, Djokovic was back to his ruthless best and blasted past a shell-shocked Griekspoor to take the first set with two breaks of serve.

The 22-times Grand Slam champion was in no mood to waste any more time after a couple of short delays due to light rain as he attacked his Dutch opponent's serve early in the next set.

Firing winners at will from the baseline, the Serbian also showed soft hands with a vintage drop shot and followed it up with a stunning pass at the net before surging to a 4-0 lead.

Griekspoor managed to win a game and world number one Djokovic dropped serve with a double fault before sealing victory in style.

""It's been a great evening for me. Yesterday, I really had to work hard to get a win,"" Djokovic said.

""Tonight, right from the beginning I was sharp. I played better quality tennis. Maybe the last three or four games were not the best to close the match but I managed to find the good serve in the end.

""I'm very pleased ... with the way I felt on the court and hopefully things can go in the right direction for tomorrow.""

The Serbian will next face either Pavel Kotov or Hubert Hurkacz.

Earlier, holder Andrey Rublev saved five match points in a thrilling 1-6 7-6(6) 7-6(3) victory over Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. The Russian will next take on Botic van de Zandschulp who beat Mikael Ymer 3-6 6-3 6-3.

""These matches, when it's over and somehow you win, it's always special. I don't know. I have no words to describe it,"" Rublev, who has saved match points en route to victory three times this season, said.

""One time maybe you feel lucky, you feel super tight and emotional because you almost lose. When it happens for a third time, you think now there's no chance.

""When you're three times lucky it's like 'How many more Christmas presents do I have?'""

Lorenzo Sonego also advanced with a stunning 7-6(4) 6-4 win over fourth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime.

He meets Alexander Zverev after the seventh seed downed Christopher O'Connell 7-5 6-4 to reach the last eight of an event for the first time since his run to the Roland Garros semi-finals where he suffered a serious ankle injury."
7,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/pga-tour-reduce-fields-and-cut-lines-designated-events-3316881,"The PGA Tour has approved changes for 2024 that will see reduced fields and no cuts at the designated events it created last year in response to the threat posed by the Saudi-backed LIV Golf circuit, according to a memo obtained by Reuters on Wednesday.

The sweeping changes, which were outlined in a letter sent to PGA Tour members by Commissioner Jay Monahan, do not apply to all elevated events as the four majors, The Players Championship and three FedExCup playoff events will be unaffected.

""These smaller, designated event fields will not only deliver substantial, can't-miss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season, but they will also enhance the quality of full-field events,"" wrote Monahan.

""Together, this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive, compelling, consequential and with clarity for fans, players and sponsors alike.""

According to the memo, select designated events in 2024 will feature limited fields of between 70 to 80 players with no cuts taking place after 36 holes and with opportunities for in-form players from full-field events to qualify and compete.

By comparison, last month's Phoenix Open, which was the PGA Tour's first fully-fledged designated event, had a field of 136 golfers that was cut to 66 after the second round.

Designated events were announced by the PGA Tour last August to get the best players competing against each other more often. The move came amid the threat posed by LIV Golf, which features limited-field, 54-hole events with no cuts and guaranteed prize money for each golfer.

""Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Congratulations PGA Tour. Welcome to the future,"" read a message posted on LIV Golf's Twitter account on Wednesday as news of the PGA Tour's designated event changes circulated online.

""FAIR SHAKE""

Starting next year, designated events will include the top 50 players from the previous year's FedExCup regular season list along with the top 10 players not otherwise eligible from the current points list.

Other qualification criteria include performance in non-designated events, consideration of the world rankings and sponsor exemptions for some PGA Tour members.

World number three Rory McIlroy, speaking to reporters ahead of this week's Arnold Palmer Invitational, said the changes will make the PGA Tour more competitive.

""I'm all about rewarding good play. ... I want to give everyone a fair shake at this. Which I think this structure has done. There's ways to play into it,"" McIlroy, who also holds a position on the PGA Tour's Player Advisory Council, said at Bay Hill in Orlando, Florida.

""It's trying to get the top guys versus the hot guys, right? I think that creates a really compelling product. But a way that you don't have to wait an entire year for your good play to then get the opportunity. That opportunity presents itself straight away.""

Max Homa, ranked eighth in the world and also a member of the Player Advisory Council, acknowledged the emergence of LIV Golf, which has lured many big names from the PGA Tour, may have forced the U.S.-based circuit to rethink things.

""One of the things that they have that's great that this will provide now is a guaranteed product. You know who is going to be at each event,"" said Homa.

""I don't think we would be here this soon without LIV, but I would hope at some point we would have looked at this and said, Hey, there might be a better way to do it."""
8,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/ukraine-invasion-russian-chess-players-compete-asian-federation-after-quitting-europe-3315401,"BERLIN: Chess powerhouse Russia has joined the Asian Chess Federation (ACF) following an ACF vote that allows Russian players to keep competing at an international level despite the war in Ukraine and the sanctions that it has prompted.

Russian athletes have been banned from many sports and largely cannot compete in Europe due to the sanctions and competition complications caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb 24, 2022.

However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) last month urged sports federations to create a pathway for Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to international competitions in Asia.

This pathway would also give those athletes the chance to qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympics through Asian qualifying events as they are unable to compete in Europe.

Belarus is also under Western sanctions because it has allowed Russia to use its territory as a key staging area for the invasion.

""This day witnessed a historic event: A chess federation, one of the strongest in the world, has moved from one continent to another for the first time ever,"" Russian chess federation president Andrey Filatov said on Tuesday (Feb 28) following the ACF vote in Abu Dhabi.

""We are grateful to the delegates for having supported our transition to the ACF at the Continental Assembly by a majority of votes. It goes to show the amount of trust in us on the one hand, and the good work achieved by our federation on the other.""

Of the 36 votes, 29 ACF delegates voted in favour of Russia's inclusion and one voted against, while there were also six abstentions, with the result sealing Russia's departure from the European Chess Union.

Many countries have publicly opposed the IOC's plan to see a return of Russian and Belarusian athletes in international competitions, while Ukraine has threatened to boycott the Paris Olympics if Russians are allowed to compete, even as neutral athletes with no flag or anthem, as proposed.

In response to queries from CNA, the Singapore Chess Federation (SCF) said that it was one of the six that abstained from the vote.

""This decision was arrived at after an internal discussion within our executive council and after seeking the advice of Sport Singapore,"" said SCF CEO Kevin Goh.

""Russia is a traditional powerhouse in chess and we look forward to their contributions to chess development in this region."""
9,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/just-fontaine-world-cup-record-scorer-dies-3315191,"PARIS: Just Fontaine, the all-time top scorer in a single World Cup finals with 13 goals, has died aged 89, his family told AFP on Wednesday (Mar 1).

Fontaine achieved the record during the 1958 finals in Sweden, where France reached the semi-finals for the first time in their history.

To this day, only three players have scored more World Cup goals than Fontaine, even though the Reims player appeared at just one tournament and played only six matches.

Lionel Messi matched his tally on Argentina's recent run to glory in Qatar, but it took him five World Cups to get there.

That 1958 World Cup in Sweden is best remembered as the coming of age of a 17-year-old Pele, who inspired Brazil to victory after netting a hat-trick in their 5-2 semi-final win over France.

However, it was a personal triumph for Fontaine, whose four-goal haul in the third-place playoff win over West Germany ensured that he had scored in every game.

Part of a wonderful attacking trident alongside Roger Piantoni and Raymond Kopa, Fontaine might never have gone to Sweden at all.

Only injuries to Thadee Cisowski and his Reims teammate Rene Bliard saw him make the squad and then the starting line-up.

""It was only at the airport before leaving for Sweden that Paul Nicolas (part of the national team staff) and Albert Batteux (the France coach), who didn't really want me, told me I would be playing as centre-forward,"" Fontaine told AFP in 2013.

Only Germany's Miroslav Klose (16), Brazil's Ronaldo (15) and Gerd Muller, the West German hero of the 1970s who scored 14 times, have netted more World Cup finals goals.

Just two other players - Muller with 10 in 1970 and Hungary's Sandor Kocsis with 11 in 1954 - have reached double figures at a single World Cup.

Yet, Kopa is remembered as the biggest French star of the era. When he died in 2017, Fontaine remembered fondly his ""big brother"".

""Raymond had character,"" he said. ""So did I, and that made us a magical duo.""

Born in Marrakech in August 1933 to a French father and Spanish mother at the time of the French Protectorate in Morocco, Fontaine went to school in Casablanca, and began his football career there."

South Africa limped to 49 for four in their second innings having been all out for 342 in their first early on the second morning.

They dismissed West Indies for 212 in reply as seamer Gerald Coetzee also claimed figures of 2-45 on debut, with 24 wickets already lost in six sessions in the match.

Dean Elgar (1), debutant Tony de Zorzi (0), Keegan Petersen (7) and Temba Bavuma (0), with a pair of ducks, are all already dismissed for the home side in their second innings.

Bavuma is the fourth player to get a pair on their test captaincy debut after Mark Taylor, Rashid Latif and Habibul Bashar.

First innings centurion Aiden Markram (35 not out) and Heinrich Klaasen (0 not out) will resume on the third morning, hoping to build on what is already a sizeable advantage.

Seamer Alzarri Joseph (2-17) has impressed again after he claimed a maiden test five-wicket haul in South Africa's first innings with 5-81.

""It's not the quickest wicket, it's going a little up and down, but we are just sticking to our plans,"" Nortje said. ""I need to adjust a little now and then. It's just about finding that rhythm.

""We need some sort of partnership to take the lead to 250-plus. Definitely that's very competitive. The more we can get the better, but I would think 250-plus is a very good score.""

West Indies made a strong start to their first innings but lost their final seven wickets for 43 runs as Nortje proved chief destroyer.

Kagiso Rabada (2-44) claimed the first wicket with a beautiful delivery that angled into captain Kraigg Brathwaite (11) and then seamed away off the pitch and hit the top of off-stump.

Tagenarine Chanderpaul (22), son of West Indies great Shivnarine, was caught by Senuran Muthusamy at gully to give Coetzee his first test wicket.

The visitors showed some dogged determination in the face of hostile home bowling and Blackwood reached 37 before an inside edge off Nortje was caught by diving wicketkeeper Klaasen.

They were still sitting relatively comfortably on 169 for three, but when innings top scorer Raymon Reifer (62) was caught by Klaasen off Marco Jansen, it precipitated a collapse."
11,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/glazers-demands-set-delay-manchester-united-takeover-reports-3315686,"LONDON: Plans for a takeover of Manchester United could be delayed until May, with the current US-based owners the Glazer family said to be holding out for a better offer, according to British media reports.

The Daily Mail reported this week that the Glazers wanted a bid of at least £6 billion (US$7.2 billion, 6.8 billion euros) after initial offers from Qatari's Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani and British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe were lodged at a maximum of £4.5 billion.

The Mail said this might mean a sale of the club, which won its first trophy in six years by collecting the League Cup on Sunday (Feb 26), would not take place until May at the earliest.

In another report, the Guardian said there was indecision among the six Glazer siblings because each had their own view of any takeover but that the sale remained ""under serious consideration by the family as a whole"".

Sheikh Jassim, 41, educated at Britain's elite Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, claims to be a long-time United fan.

He was the first to submit a bid by the ""soft deadline"" of Feb 17 and has promised a ""completely debt free"" takeover of United.

Boyhood United fan Ratcliffe, who was born in the Manchester area, is one of Britain's wealthiest individuals, with an estimated net worth of £12.5 billion following the success of INEOS, his global chemical company.

He is keen to expand a sporting portfolio that already includes French football club Nice and Swiss team FC Lausanne-Sport, as well as the cycling team Ineos Grenadiers, formerly Team Sky.

A price tag of around US$6 billion would smash the record fee for a football club set when a consortium led by LA Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital purchased Chelsea last year.

Russ Mould, investment director at Manchester-headquartered stockbrokers AJ Bell, told AFP on Wednesday: ""As bidders continue to circle one of the globe's most valuable sports franchises, it seems no party has reached the £6 billion valuation put on the business by Manchester United's current owners.""

IMPROVEMENT UNDER TEN HAG

United, one of the most successful clubs in English football history, have struggled to keep pace with bitter rivals Manchester City since the retirement of legendary manager Alex Ferguson in 2013.

But under disciplinarian Dutch manager Erik ten Hag, United appear to be on the rise and ended their long wait for silverware by beating Newcastle 2-0 in the League Cup final at Wembley.

They are also third in the Premier League, they beat Barcelona last week to progress to the last 16 of the Europa League and were facing West Ham in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Wednesday.

Mould said that with United's prospects on the pitch looking rosier, the Glazers might think twice about ceding full control of the club.

""Speculation has been growing that should Erik ten Hag's revolution in performance that has seen Manchester United go through an improved run of form and win their first trophy since 2017 continue, the family could be less willing to sell the club.""

If the Glazers do decide to hang on to all or part of the club, it would be deeply unpopular with United's supporters, who have frequently demonstrated en masse against the American owners who they accuse of taking money out of the club over the years."

The Brumbies dominated their Australian rivals last year but fell short in a 20-19 thriller at Eden Park as the Blues booked their place in the final against the eventual champion Canterbury Crusaders.

The Blues have won their last 14 regular season matches, including last week's 60-20 hiding of the Otago Highlanders in their season-opener in Dunedin.

The Brumbies, however, have proved tough foes for the Blues and head into Sunday's afternoon clash at the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium confident after a solid 31-25 win over the improving New South Wales Waratahs.

""We know the Brumbies will bring a physical, confronting game and we have been preparing all week to meet that challenge,"" Blues captain Dalton Papalii said.

All matches will be played at the Rectangular Stadium in three consecutive days of double-headers as part of the competition's ""Super Round"".

The Crusaders, who face the Otago Highlanders on Friday, might welcome the chance to play in a city where rugby is barely on the radar given the media storm over the All Blacks' coaching situation back home.

Within six weeks, Crusaders' coach Scott Robertson is expected to be confirmed as Ian Foster's successor as All Blacks coach after the World Cup in France, regardless of the application process announced by New Zealand Rugby (NZR) on Wednesday.

The Crusaders were upset 31-10 by the Waikato Chiefs in a major shock at home last weekend, and Robertson will not want another defeat on his ledger before interviews with NZR.

He will have veteran All Blacks lock Sam Whitelock back in the side fore the Highlanders clash and has restored the formidable midfield partnership of David Havili and Jack Goodhue after using Havili at fullback last week.

The Wellington Hurricanes will look to back up their impressive 47-13 win away to the Queensland Reds when they meet the home team, Melbourne Rebels, on Friday.

Hurricanes winger Julian Savea scored his 58th try against the Reds and can match Israel Folau's all-time Super Rugby record with a double against the Rebels.

The Waratahs experimented with dual opensides in their back row against the Brumbies but ditched that after one match, dropping Charlie Gamble to the bench for their match against Fijian Drua on Saturday.

The Western Force, meanwhile, have promoted comeback king Jeremy Thrush to their starting lineup for Sunday's match against the Reds after the 37-year-old lock scored the winning try off the bench against the Rebels last week.

Thrush retired in the off-season but was coaxed back to the game after an injury to Izack Rodda.

The Chiefs will look to continue their perfect start when they meet Moana Pasifika in the early match on Saturday."

The vessel, which authorities believe was carrying up to 200 migrants, sank in rough seas before dawn on Sunday near Steccato di Cutro, a seaside resort in southern Italy. Sixteen children were among the dead.

Those on board were mostly from Afghanistan but also from Pakistan, Syria, the Palestinian Territories, Iran and Somalia, Italian authorities said.

""Pakistani authorities have informed Raza's family that the Pakistani national team hockey player perished in the boating accident off the coast of Italy,"" Qadir Ali Nayel, a legislator from Balochistan province, told Reuters late on Wednesday.

A knee issue has long bothered Stokes and he has come under pressure in some quarters to rest the joint and skip his lucrative stint in the IPL with the Chennai Super Kings from the end of the month.

McCullum, however, said the all-rounder had built a career on peaking in big moments and the Ashes series against Australia in June and July would be no different.

""I ... believe that the Ashes is the script that the skipper is waiting to write, so he'll be sweet. I don't have any concerns,"" he told reporters in Wellington at the conclusion of the drawn series with New Zealand.

""I don't think he's jeopardising it. I know that Chennai set-up, I played for that franchise, and it is excellent in looking after the players.

""He knows how to get right for the big moments. His life is that, right? When he comes back into the fold and leads us into the Ashes campaign, he'll have the bit between his teeth and I think we'll be all right.""

Stokes has already said he will leave the IPL early to prepare for a one-off test against Ireland at Lord's on June 1 and the first Ashes test at Edgbaston, which starts on Jun 16.

McCullum and Stokes have led England to 10 wins in 12 tests since taking over early last year on the back of an entertaining style of play dubbed ""Bazball"" after the coach's nickname.

The second defeat came in the most dramatic of circumstances on Tuesday when New Zealand triumphed by a single run to become only the fourth team to win a test after being asked to follow on.

McCullum, like Stokes, was unapologetic for the decision to enforce the follow on and said there was unlikely to be much change to the way England approached the game.

""I think there'll be tens of millions of people around the world that sat back and enjoyed that test match,"" he added.

""Now we have the opportunity to really ... turn our attention to what's going to be a pretty amazing time in the guys' lives - an Ashes series at home against a good Australian side.

""We'll go into it with a lot of confidence. We know it's not going to be easy, but I'm pretty sure we will play a very similar style of cricket that we've played throughout the last eight or nine months. And with eight or nine months of development of that style under our belt, we should be hard to beat."""
20,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/miracle-says-grimsby-boss-hurst-after-glory-night-mariners-3317116,"Better-known for its fishing industry, fourth-tier minnows Grimsby Town splashed some FA Cup magic by knocking out Premier League Southampton to reach the quarter-finals for the first time in 84 years on Wednesday.

With 4,000 fans making the long journey from the Humber Estuary to the Solent, many wielding inflatable haddocks, Grimsby belied their lowly status with a deserved win.

Two penalties netted by Gavan Holohan either side of halftime sealed a 2-1 victory on one of the biggest nights in Grimsby's history and their reward is a trip to top-flight Brighton and Hove Albion in the last eight - a clash destined to be billed as the Seagulls versus Haddocks.

Manager Paul Hurst described it as a 'miracle' as his side became only the sixth team from the fourth tier or below to reach the last eight of the FA Cup Cup since the introduction of the division in 1958-59.

""I'm in shock a little bit. Just delighted for the players. What an effort. We kept disciplined. Look at what that means to the support,"" Hurst said as the visiting fans celebrated loudly.

""We turned up, hoping for a miracle and to be in the quarter-final is incredible. It is just a fantastic day, we have gone down in the history books. It is a very special day.""

Grimsby's hearts were in their mouths as Duje Caleta-Car gave Southampton a lifeline and then Theo Walcott appeared to have equalised with 10 minutes to go, only for his effort to be chalked off by VAR for offside.

Grimsby's win means they are the first team in the competition's history to eliminate five different teams from a higher division in one season.

""I know that there were a few who thought we could get a result going into it, but maybe I thought they were crazy,"" Hurst told the club's Twitter feed.

""But when we went two up a few more started to believe.""

For Premier League bottom club Southampton it was another low point in a miserable season."

Marseille's Leonardo Balerdi missed the decisive penalty for the hosts as Annecy joined Olympique Lyonnais, Nantes and Toulouse in the semi-finals.

Jordan Veretout scored for Marseille after 29 minutes when he was played free by Jonathan Clauss and calmly placed the ball into the corner.

Annecy turned the match around at the beginning of the second half when Dion Sahi equalised before Kevin Mouanga sent the visitors ahead.

The loud cheers at the Stade Velodrome changed to boos from the home fans venting frustration as the clocked ticked to 90 minutes, and reached a crescendo when Alexis Sanchez failed to convert a penalty after a handball six minutes from time.

Six minutes into stoppage-time, however, Francois-Regis Mughe did get an equaliser to send the match to penalties.

Holders Nantes and Toulouse reached the semi-finals earlier on Wednesday. Nantes claimed a 2-1 win over Lens thanks to two penalties from Andy Delort while Toulouse crushed Ligue 2 club Rodez AF 6-1 at home.

Goals by forwards Bradley Barcola and Jeffinho helped Lyon beat second-tier side Grenoble 2-1 on Tuesday.

Ligue 1 leaders Paris St Germain went out of the tournament after a 2-1 loss at Marseille last month."

Both teams will meet again in Bilbao on April 4 with the winner to face either Real Madrid or Barcelona, who will play their semi-final first-leg on Thursday.

The Basque Country rivals played out a bruising encounter on a freezing night in Pamplona, with neither side showing much quality in the final third while six players were booked as tempers flared.

Osasuna were the better side for large parts of the match but almost fell behind early in the first half when an Iker Muniain strike from the edge of the area deflected off a defender and wrongfooted the goalkeeper who managed to make a desperate goalline save with his boot.

Osasuna took advantage of one of their few opportunities, breaking the deadlock two minutes after the break in a lightning-fast counter-attack led by Abde.

The Barcelona academy player, who is on a loan at Osasuna, ran down the left channel, dribbled past a defender and slotted a precise shot just inside the left post."

Three days after they won the League Cup, Manchester United trailed to Said Benrahma's 54th-minute goal at Old Trafford but an own goal by West Ham's Nayef Aguerd and late strikes from Alejandro Garnacho and Fred sent the hosts into the last eight.

Manchester manager Erik Ten Hag was delighted with his players.

""The resilience from this team and the belief they're going to win it was magnificent,"" the Dutchman told ITV.

West Ham, who have won only once at Old Trafford in their last 22 visits, took advantage of sloppy defending to open the scoring.

Tomas Soucek kept the ball in play on the left touchline and as Manchester United players appealed for a throw-in, the Czech played the ball to Benrahma who fired a shot past David De Gea into the top corner.

United thought they had equalised when Bruno Fernandes found Casemiro with a pin-point free kick, but his headed effort was disallowed for offside.

The game looked set for extra time until Argentine forward Garnacho controlled the ball inside West Ham's penalty area before curling a shot past keeper Alphonse Areola.

Brazilian Fred added a third and the 12-times FA Cup winners advanced to a sixth-round home tie against Fulham.

""I had a strong feeling that we still could win the game, you saw the belief, there was composure, there was never a moment of panic,"" Ten Hag said.

Tottenham suffered a 1-0 loss at Championship side Sheffield United after Iliman Ndiaye scored 11 minutes from time to stun the visitors.

""The performance from all the players was first class and the experienced boys at the back were class too,"" Sheffield United manager Paul Heckingbottom told the BBC.

Grimsby Town, 16th in League Two, continued their dream FA Cup run as two penalties by Gavan Holohan knocked out Southampton 2-1 on their own ground and sent the fourth-tier side into the last eight for the first time in 84 years.

Grimsby led 2-0 soon after halftime but Southampton pulled one back through Duje Caleta-Car to ensure a tense finale.

""Just delighted for the players. We kept disciplined. Look at what that means to the support. We turned up, hoping for a miracle and to be in the quarter-final is incredible. It is just a fantastic day,"" Grimsby manager Paul Hurst told ITV.

Grimsby are only the sixth team from the fourth tier or below to reach the last eight of the FA Cup since the introduction of the division in 1958-59.

Haouas was shown a red card in the 13th minute of France's 32-21 win over Scotland on Sunday for a head-first charge at Ben White's head. The Frenchman was also shown a red while playing against Scotland in the 2020 Six Nations.

The 28-year-old was brought into the side to replace Uini Atonio, who was handed a ban last month.

A Six Nations statement on Wednesday said Haouas ""admitted that he had committed an act of foul play warranting the issue of a red card prior to the hearing"".

""After reviewing all the evidence, the committee ... applied World Rugby's mandatory minimum mid-range entry point for foul play resulting in contact with the head. This resulted in a starting point of a six week suspension,"" the statement added.

""Having acknowledged that there were no aggravating factors and accepted mitigating factors ... the committee reduced the six week entry point by two weeks, resulting in a sanction of four weeks.""

Defending champions France, who are fourth in the standings, next face England at Twickenham on March 11. They then host Wales on Mar 18."
34,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/police-confirm-potential-top-5-draft-pick-jalen-carter-will-turn-himself-3316416,"On the cusp of the biggest moment of his life, Georgia defensive tackle Jalen Carter faces arrest warrants for reckless driving and racing in connection with the Jan. 15 fatal crash that claimed the life of Bulldogs offensive lineman Devin Willock and football department staffer Chandler LeCroy.

Both charges are misdemeanors punishable by up to a $1,000 fine and one year in jail.

""It is my understanding that Mr. Carter is making arrangements to turn himself in. At this time, no other charges are pending,"" Lt. Shaun Barnett of the Athens-Clarke County Police Department told Field Level Media on Wednesday.

Carter, 21, was interviewed by police and told authorities he wasn't present at the time of the accident, according to the police report.

But details of the arrest warrant, citing video recorded before the crash, allege Carter was the driver of a 2021 Jeep Trailhawk that pushed LeCroy, who was driving a 2021 Ford Expedition, to speeds exceeding 100 mph.

""The investigation found that (Carter and LeCroy) were operating their vehicles in a manner consistent with racing shortly after leaving the downtown Athens area at about 2:30 AM,"" the warrant from Athens-Clarke County Policy Department said Wednesday. ""The evidence demonstrated that both vehicles switched between lanes, drove in the center turn lane, drove in the opposite lanes of travel, overtook other motorists, and drove at high rates of speed, in an apparent attempt to outdistance each other. Evidence indicate shortly before the crash the Expedition was traveling about 104 miles per hour. The toxicology report indicated that LeCroy's blood alcohol concentration was .197 at the time of the crash. Investigators determined that alcohol impairment, racing, reckless driving and speed were significant contributing factors to the crash.""

The legal blood alcohol concentration limit in Georgia is 0.08 per cent.

Police said the case was given to the Solicitor General's Office on Wednesday.

The report was released just 20 minutes before Carter was scheduled to take the podium in a press conference setting at the 2023 NFL Scouting Combine. Carter is ranked among the top players in the draft and considered a likely top-5 pick in April.

Carter never took the podium because he reportedly left town on Tuesday night.

He was in Indianapolis on Monday and Tuesday and met with teams in formal interviews before the warrant was issued.

Georgia head coach Kirby Smart said his program is still mourning the loss of a player and staff member.

""The charges announced today are deeply concerning, especially as we are still struggling to cope with the devastating loss of two beloved members of our community,"" Smart said in a statement released Wednesday.

""We will continue to cooperate fully with the authorities while supporting these families and assessing what we can learn from this horrible tragedy.""

The warrant was issued just as former Georgia linebacker Nolan Smith was at a podium in Indianapolis in a press conference. He was asked about the crash that killed Willock, who was a good friend.

That's my guy,"" Smith said before emotions began to overtake him, causing his hands and lips to quiver. ""I get sensitive talking about it just because I love him. And he never did anything wrong in his three years. He was supposed to graduate. Most people don't know his brother passed like that. No one should deserve to die like that.""

Smith shook his head as he continued, banging the lectern and removing his steamed glasses from his face covered in tears.

""Three years in a row, that man showed up (and) worked day in and day out. He's a two-time natty champ, man. And it's written in stone. Devin, I love you, baby. Seven-seven (Willock's jersey number), you living forever. 'Do it for Dev,' that's what I tell them boys at Georgia. 'You lost a brother. Do it for Dev.' I'm sorry to get emotional, man.""

Police said Carter also was ticketed in September for driving 89 mph in a 45 mph zone.
