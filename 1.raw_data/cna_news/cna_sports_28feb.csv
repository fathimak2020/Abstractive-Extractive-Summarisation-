Messi beat his Paris Saint-Germain teammate, and World Cup final rival, Kylian Mbappe to the men's gong with Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema the other contender to claim the prize.

It is the second time that Messi has won the honour inaugurated by FIFA in 2016 after football's world governing body split from Ballon d'Or organisers France Football.

The award, which is voted for by national team coaches and captains, journalists and also fans, recognises a year in which the former Barcelona star crowned his glorious career by leading Argentina to victory at the World Cup.

Messi scored twice in an epic final in Doha as Argentina beat France on penalties despite Mbappe netting a hat-trick for Les Bleus in a remarkable 3-3 draw.

He also claimed the Golden Ball for the best player at the tournament, although Mbappe was the top scorer with eight goals, one more than Messi.

""This year was just mad for me, to be able to achieve my dream that I had fought so hard for. In the end I got it and it was the most beautiful thing that has happened in my career,"" Messi said of his World Cup win as he collected his award.

""It is a dream for every footballer but something that very few can make come true,"" added Messi, who was sat in the Paris theatre in between Mbappe and his wife Antonella Roccuzzo.

He took the prize just 24 hours after combining with Mbappe to lead PSG to a 3-0 win against Marseille in Ligue 1.

PUTELLAS PIPS MEAD AND MORGAN

The 35-year-old, a seven-time Ballon d'Or winner, succeeds Robert Lewandowski on the FIFA honours list, while Putellas retained the women's prize despite spending the second half of last year out injured.

The 29-year-old beat England's European Championship-winning striker Beth Mead and United States star Alex Morgan to add the FIFA crown to the Ballon d'Or, which she has also won two years running.

Putellas is currently recovering from a serious knee injury suffered last July which saw her miss the Euro in England with Spain.

Prior to that she had scored 11 goals on Barcelona's run to the Champions League final, which they lost to Lyon.

Putellas has previously said she hopes to return from injury in time to play again this season, but it remains to be seen whether she will feature for Spain at the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in July and August.

Argentina's World Cup win in Qatar was also recognised as Lionel Scaloni claimed the men's coach's honour and Emiliano Martinez was named the best male goalkeeper.

Meanwhile, England's European Championship victory helped their Dutch manager Sarina Wiegman win the prize for best women's coach, while Mary Earps was named the women's goalkeeper of the year.

The France international had an operation on a damaged meniscus in September and also missed the World Cup in Qatar with the national team.

The only time Pogba has been part of the squad this season was as an unused substitute in the 2-0 loss against Monza on Jan. 29.

""Pogba will be called up for the derby and will play if necessary. He doesn't have much playing time in his legs, but more than enough,"" Allegri told reporters.

""I have spoken to him as I have done with the other players. He must understand that we're at an important stage of the season. He must have the drive to have given his contribution at the end of the season.""

Allegri added that forward Federico Chiesa, who has been on and off with injuries this season, is also back in regular training after missing recent games.

""Yesterday, Chiesa trained with the team after six so-so days. Now to say that Pogba can be a starter after 315 days on the sidelines or likewise, Chiesa, who has been out for 10 months, is another thing. A little patience is needed,"" Allegri said.

""(Leonardo) Bonucci is fine, but due to his long period of inactivity, he'll be sitting close to me at kick-off tomorrow evening. But having him back is already an important plus, he is the club captain after all.""

Allegri's side are eighth in the standings on 32 points, one above city rivals Torino ahead of the home clash, and will aim to expand their winning streak to four league matches.

""Torino are a team moulded by coach (Ivan) Juric, teams that have a very specific playing system. They attack a lot, they pile on a lot of pressure. These matches are very intense but we've done well at immersing ourselves in these kinds of challenges. If we think we can play on our tiptoes, we're done for,"" Allegri said.

Juve were deducted 15 points for the current season by an Italian soccer court investigating the club's transfer dealings in January. Still, Allegri said that the season's main goal has not changed.

""Regardless of what happens off the pitch, we have earned 47 points and we must try and stay in the top four, one of our aims at the start of the season,"" he said."

Djokovic, 35, has 6,980 points in the latest ATP Rankings, 200 more than No 2 Carlos Alcaraz of Spain.

""It's surreal to be that many weeks No 1, to match Graf - one of the all-time greats,"" Djokovic said. ""Just being amongst these legendary names is flattering. I'm proud of it.""

Djokovic first rose to No 1 at the age of 24 on Jul 4, 2011. He spent a personal-best 122 consecutive weeks at the top from 2014-16.

Djokovic won his men's record-tying 22nd major title last month at the Australian Open. The Serbian star returns to action Tuesday at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships.

Graf, also a 22-time Grand Slam winner, was No 1 in the women's rankings for 377 weeks before retiring in 1999.

Martina Navratilova ranks third on the all-time list with 332 weeks at No 1, with Serena Williams (319) and Roger Federer (310) rounding out the top five."

Djokovic suffered a 3cm hamstring tear en route to winning the Adelaide warm-up event before claiming his 22nd Grand Slam title at Melbourne Park to go level with Rafa Nadal.

The 35-year-old Serb said his Dubai participation was in doubt until a few days ago but he had passed all his fitness tests.

""Had a couple of weeks of no tennis. The last few days it's really getting as much practice as possible to get myself back in shape to be able to compete at a high level,"" Djokovic said.

""I haven't felt pain on the court for a week. I'm getting closer to 100 per cent. Still not there in terms of the game and how I feel on court. But the important thing is there's no pain. I don't have a hindrance in the way I move on the court.

""After every injury it takes time for mechanisms to be balanced, for adjustments to be done on court. It takes time to find that groove of moving effortlessly and not thinking about if something's going to happen. I don't have those thoughts.""

Djokovic begins the Dubai tournament having entered his 378th week as world number one, surpassing Steffi Graf as the player with the most weeks at the top of the sport.

""It's surreal to be that many weeks number one, to match Graf - one of the all-time greats,"" Djokovic said. ""Just being amongst these legendary names is flattering. I'm proud of it.""

The 27-year-old Australian had a terrific second half of 2022. After contesting his first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon in July, he won the ATP 500 Citi Open in August, and reached to U.S. Open quarter-finals in September.

But pain in his knee forced him to withdraw from the Japan Open in October and he then pulled out of his home major, the Australian Open, in January and underwent surgery.

A 24-year-old woman has accused the Moroccan international of raping her at his home in a Paris suburb on February 25.

According to the source, confirming an article in the Parisien newspaper, the woman reported the incident at a police station on Sunday but did not file charges.

The public prosecutor's office handling the case in Nanterre declined to comment, but complained to AFP that ""information already made public"" in the media ""undermined the necessary investigations to find out the truth"".

Hakimi was part of the Morocco team that finished fourth in the World Cup in Qatar.

And late Monday he was at the FIFA Best awards ceremony in Paris, where he was named in the FIFPro men's world team of the year.

On stage to collect the award he stood alongside another award winner, his PSG teammate and close friend, Kylian Mbappe.

Mbappe's France may have ended Morocco's World Cup adventure but Hakimi had spoken of their friendship before the competition: ""We are two young men who have like the same things, we chat about music, video games, we go to restaurants,"" he told the Parisien.

Born in Madrid, his penalty secured a 3-0 shoot-out win over Spain to steer Morocco into uncharted territory, with the north African side going on to become the first from the Arab world to reach the last four at a World Cup."

Scaloni renewed his contract after meeting with AFA president Claudio Tapia in Paris on Monday, taking him through to the next World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

""Claudio Tapia and Lionel Scaloni met to close the extension of the contract as coach of the Senior Selection until 2026,"" the AFA said in a statement.

Later on Monday Scaloni, who is in Paris for FIFA's 'The Best' Awards ceremony, was named Best Coach of 2022.

""I am eternally grateful to the president of the AFA for giving me the opportunity to coach this wonderful national team,"" Scaloni said on receiving the award.

""I'm thankful for the players, those 26 who led us to glory. Without them we could not have achieved anything.""

Scaloni, who played for Argentina's Newell's Old Boys, Lazio and Mallorca, began his link with the national team as part of the coaching staff led by Jorge Sampaoli, who was sacked after they exited in the last 16 at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

Scaloni, 44, gave the squad captained by Lionel Messi a thorough overhaul, winning the Copa America in 2021 plus the 'Finalissima' against Italy and World Cup in 2022. He has a record of 37 wins, 15 draws and five defeats in 57 games.

""When confidence is high, communication is simple and effective. We continue to strengthen the national team project, together with Lionel Scaloni, the world champion coach,"" said Tapia."

Former Germany coach Klinsmann replaced Paulo Bento, who stepped down following South Korea's defeat by Brazil in the World Cup last 16 in December.

The Korea Football Association (KFA) said Klinsmann had signed a contract until the 2026 World Cup, which will be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

""I know that the Korean national team has been improving and achieving results over a long period of time,"" Klinsmann said in a statement.

""I am honoured to follow in the footsteps of the great coaches who have led the Korean national team, from Gus Hiddink to my predecessor, Paulo Bento.

""I look forward to doing my utmost to help the team achieve success at the upcoming Asian Cup and the 2026 World Cup.""

After retiring as a player in 1998, Klinsmann was Germany's head coach from 2004-06 and led them to a third-place finish at the 2006 World Cup on home soil.

He managed his former club Bayern Munich in the 2008-09 season before becoming head coach of the US national team from 2011 to 2016.

The 58-year-old led the US to the CONCACAF Gold Cup title in 2013 and was named the CONCACAF Coach of the Year.

Klinsmann's first match in charge of South Korea will be a home friendly against Colombia on Mar 24.

The KFA said Klinsmann's coaching team had not been finalised, adding that the German would live in South Korea for the duration of his tenure."
11,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/psg-romp-3-0-win-over-marseille-thanks-mbappe-messi-double-act-3307281,"PARIS: World Cup foes Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe inspired Paris St Germain to a 3-0 win at bitter rivals Olympique de Marseille on Sunday to extend their Ligue 1 lead to eight points.

Mbappe, who bagged a double, was set up by Messi for both his goals, and repaid the favour by laying on another for the Argentine forward as PSG, who were without the injured Neymar, moved to 60 points from 25 games with second-placed Marseille on 52.

France forward Mbappe, who was on the losing side against Messi's Argentina in the World Cup final, became PSG's joint record scorer with 200 goals - level with Edinson Cavani - while Messi netted his 700th in club football.

""We were aggressive, we put intensity into the game, that's what we'd been missing,"" said PSG centre back Sergio Ramos.

Marseille coach Igor Tudor said he did not regret his side's high-risk approach.

""Why should we have changed our way of playing? It has been working well this season,"" he said.

""Mbappe's presence didn't change anything. His presence made it more difficult for us to play our game but we were not going to change it.""

Third-placed Monaco slumped to a 3-0 home defeat against Nice, who prevailed thanks to a Terem Moffi double and a superb half-volley by Khephren Thuram.

The result left Monaco on 50 points, ahead of fourth-placed RC Lens on goals scored after the northerners drew 1-1 at Montpellier on Saturday.

PSG, who were knocked out of the French Cup in the last 16 by Marseille earlier this month, ended a three-game losing streak in all competitions by beating Lille last weekend and they were focused throughout at the Velodrome.

They suffered an early injury blow when Presnel Kimpembe, who missed the World Cup for France with an Achilles issue, left the pitch on a stretcher, two weeks after making his comeback from a three-month layoff.

Matteo Guendouzi created danger as Marseille pressed high and hard but they were exposed on the counter and the hosts were punished in the 25th minute when Messi played Mbappe through for the France forward to race into the area and beat Pau Lopez with a low shot.

The roles were reversed four minutes later as Mbappe delivered a pin-point cross for Messi, who tapped in from point-blank range to double the advantage in front of an all-time Ligue 1 record attendance of 65,800.

Messi then missed a sitter and Mbappe was denied by Lopez after being found in the area by the Argentine again, just before Marquinhos's angled shot went just wide as Marseille were again caught on the break.

Messi beautifully lifted the ball into the path of Mbappe, who volleyed home with his left foot for his 16th goal of the season in Ligue 1.

Gianluigi Donnarumma made a spectacular save from Nuno Tavares's header in the 67th to snuff out any hope of a Marseille comeback as PSG secured a first clean sheet in six league games.

PSG next face Nantes at home before travelling to Bayern Munich for their Champions League last-16 return leg after losing the first encounter 1-0 at the Parc des Princes."

The complaint marks the latest development in months of investigations into alleged corruption in the planning and sponsorship of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics Games, held in 2021 after a pandemic-driven postponement.

""We determined that this is a malicious and serious case that will have a broad impact on people's lives,"" FTC investigator Goh Okumura told a media briefing.

The other companies named in the complaint are Hakuhodo DY Holdings Inc, Tokyu Agency Inc, Fuji Creative Corporation, Cerespo Co and Same Two Inc, the FTC said.

Prosecutors this month arrested a former Tokyo Olympics organising committee official and executives at Dentsu and others over the case, in which the agencies were suspected of colluding in 2018 to rig the bids for the Games' test events.

Dentsu, Cerespo and Fuji Creative have already been barred from bidding for contracts at the industry, foreign and education ministries for nine months.

The bid-rigging case comes after a bribery scandal, in which Haruyuki Takahashi, a former member of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics board and before that a Dentsu executive, was arrested last year on suspicion of receiving bribes from Olympic sponsors.

Executives from advertising firm ADK Holdings, business suits retailer Aoki Holdings and publishing firm Kadokawa have also been arrested in connection with the bribery case."

England were reduced to 80 for five in pursuit of 258 for the win, with four quick wickets falling at the Basin Reserve, but they went to the break at 168 for five.

Root put the pressure back on the Black Caps with an unbeaten 74 from 74 balls, while an ailing Stokes, battling an apparent knee problem, was 20 not out, the pair having put on 88 runs for the sixth wicket.

New Zealand's attack were a man down, with paceman Matt Henry forced off field with a back problem late in the session.

England resumed on 48 for one in the morning, needing another 210 runs for victory, and were rocked by two wickets in the opening half-hour.

Nightwatchman Ollie Robinson was out for two trying to pull a Tim Southee delivery well wide of off-stump.

He sent a top-edge high behind the slips, with Michael Bracewell jogging back to take the catch.

Opener Ben Duckett was out for 33 three overs later as he went on the attack, caught behind slashing at a wide Henry delivery.

Neil Wagner, on the receiving end of some punishing spells from England's batters this series, dismissed Ollie Pope for 14, the number three steering an edge straight to Tom Latham in the slips.

England's man of the moment Harry Brook came to the middle but was run out without facing a ball as Root made a shocking call for a single after pushing a Southee ball to the gully.

Bracewell swooped from the slips and threw to the stumps where wicketkeeper Tom Blundell whipped off the bails with Brook well short of his ground.

New Zealand introduced spin before the drinks break, with Bracewell coming into the attack but the tactic backfired as Root clobbered a six and two fours in successive balls in the all-rounder's first over.

Stokes was lucky at one stage, with Henry finding the shoulder of his bat, but the ball pinged harmlessly off Blundell's gloves.

England won the first test in Mount Maunganui by 267 runs and victory in Wellington will secure their first test series win in New Zealand since 2008."

Lazio came close to scoring in the dying seconds of the first half with striker Ciro Immobile sending an effort wide of the target.

Immobile missed another chance on the hour when, alone in the box, he sent the ball high over from close range.

Midfielder Luis Alberto secured the win when he latched on to the ball outside the box in the 80th minute and fired it to the top right corner.

The goal triggered a roar of relief from the Stadio Olimpico crowd, with Sampdoria unable to create a response before the final whistle.

HISA's program will replace the state-by-state patchwork of doping regulations with a centralized testing process, a change that comes after a series of high-profile doping scandals and horse deaths rocked the sport and spurred calls for reform.

The program is expected to receive sign off from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on March 27 and once that is received, the change will be immediate, HISA CEO Lisa Lazarus told reporters.

""I really don't think there is anything (that can delay implementation),"" Lazarus said.

""The Federal Trade Commission has to approve them... and all indications we've received from them is that they will.

""The minute they approve them, state racing commissions are out of the drug testing business and we're the sole entity responsible in those states where HISA is operating.""

Many of the same people who carry out testing on the state level will continue to do so but under HISA's regulations, said Ben Mosier, executive director of the Horseracing Integrity & Welfare Unit.

""For the first time ever we'll have a nationwide intelligence of all the testing that's done,"" Mosier said.

""Horses that travel from state to state, we can now follow those horses.""

Although HISA's anti-doping program was designed to be national, a Louisiana court stopped HISA from operating in that state and in West Virginia, so those states will not be subject to the regulations when they take effect."

32,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/guardiola-wary-bristol-citys-unbeaten-run-ahead-fa-cup-clash-3309556,"Manchester City may have avoided drawing a fellow Premier League team in the FA Cup fifth round but manager Pep Guardiola does not feel their progress is guaranteed against Championship side Bristol City who are on a 12-match unbeaten run.

Bristol City, who are managed by Nigel Pearson, have been unbeaten in all competitions since the last week of December, moving up to 13th in the second-tier Championship.

The last time the two teams faced each other at Ashton Gate, Manchester City edged Bristol City 3-2 in the League Cup semi-finals second leg in 2018 en route to Guardiola's first trophy with the English club.

""From my experience in this country, in the last six years, when you go (play) away in the FA cup at a Championship team, it is always, always tough. (Playing at) home is a little different,"" Guardiola told reporters ahead of Tuesday's clash.

""Last 12 games - no defeat. That means they are there. My scouts are saying it's a good team. The manager has experience, did really well with Leicester (City) and Watford when he was there one or two seasons ago.

""It's a final. The FA cup is a really, really important competition, so it's a serious team we will play tomorrow.""

Manchester City bounced back from two consecutive draws to beat Bournemouth 4-1 over the weekend but Guardiola feels the team can play better as they sit two points behind league leaders Arsenal, who have a game in hand.

""The way we are playing is good, results could be better. Sometimes it happens in football,"" Guardiola said.

""I have no complaints about how we are playing and how we are fighting. The mood in the locker room is exceptional and the guys are doing everything - that is enough for me.

""I have the feeling in the Premier League many things are going to happen, everyone is going to drop points. But we cannot drop any, we want to fight until the end.""

Guardiola confirmed influential midfielder Kevin De Bruyne is still suffering from ""a little bit of illness"" after sitting out the trip to Bournemouth while he will also take a late call on defenders John Stones and Aymeric Laporte."
34,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/brathwaite-braced-south-africa-challenge-first-test-3309491,"West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite believes his players must not get ahead of themselves and take each hour as it comes as they prepare to face a new-look South Africa in the first of two tests at Centurion Park on Tuesday.

The Caribbean side are coming off a 1-0 series win in Zimbabwe earlier this month, but before that were thumped in Australia late last year and will face similar seamer-friendly conditions on their short tour of South Africa.

""It won’t be easy, South Africa are a tough team at home, but we are looking forward to playing some hard days of test cricket,"" Brathwaite told reporters on Monday.

""It is important we take control of every hour, and not look at the big picture, just go from session to session.""

West Indies have lost 12 of their previous 15 tests in South Africa and won just one, though this is the first time they have toured the country in the longest format since 2015. Their only victory was a surprise success in Gqeberha 16 years ago.

Brathwaite, who opens the batting, concedes it will be a big step up from what they faced in Zimbabwe and it will be up to the batters to lay the platform for success against the home side's vaunted pace attack on helpful wickets.

""Zimbabwe isn’t a top team in the world so we are really looking to challenging ourselves here. We need to improve as batters and it is important as openers to set the foundation or the team,"" he said.

""It looks a good wicket, stats say batters can get runs on this pitch and the spinners will turn it later in the game.

""We have some very good bowlers. As a group we look forward to bowling at any batting line-up in the world. Discipline is very important, if we stick to our plans, the results will take care of themselves."""
