The visitors defended superbly after Real centre back Eder Militao scored an own goal in the first half, managing to overcome the loss of key players like Robert Lewandowski, Pedri and Ousmane Dembele who missed the game due to injuries.

Barca earned a much-needed win after arriving in the Spanish capital under pressure having been knocked out of the Europa League and losing at lowly Almeria to halt a seven-game winning streak in LaLiga.

""We would have liked to have the ball more, to control de game a little more but we fought hard and competed in a high level. They had the ball but didn’t create many chances. We got the advantage for the second leg and that’s really important,"" Barcelona captain Sergio Busquets told TVE.

Real Madrid started better and dominated the first 15 minutes, but Barcelona started to turn things around as they took control the midfield and their defensive game plan worked brilliantly.

Barca centre back Ronald Araujo did a great job at right back to neutralise the threat of the dangerous Vinicius Jr. and Karim Benzema was left alone up front.

Real became frustrated and tempers flared before the hosts made the crucial mistake which gave Barca the winner.

Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga gifted a back pass to Ferran Torres who reacted quickly to slide the ball to Franck Kessie.

His point-blank strike was saved but bounced off Militao and into the net.

The assistant referee signalled offside but the VAR replay showed Kessie was fractionally onside and the goal stood.

Barcelona locked Real Madrid into an even tighter situation during the second half and although the hosts dominated possession, they rarely threatened to equalise.

Real did not record a single shot on target despite having almost 70 per cent of possession in the second half and Barca should have extended their lead in the 71st minute when a Kessie shot that beat the goalkeeper was blocked by Ansu Fati.

Substitute Rodrygo had Real’s best chance with a late long-range strike that flew narrowly wide of the post.

The teams meet again in Barcelona on Apr 5 with the winners to face Athletic Bilbao or Osasuna in the final."
2,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/flawless-djokovic-downs-hurkacz-reach-dubai-semi-finals-3320231,":Novak Djokovic stayed on course for his third title of 2023 by powering into the semi-finals of the Dubai Tennis Championships with a 6-3 7-5 win over Hubert Hurkacz on Thursday.

The 35-year-old Serbian won in Adelaide before sealing his 22nd Grand Slam trophy at the Australian Open while managing a hamstring injury and has hit top form after a slow start in Dubai on his return to the tour.

Having breezed through the first set on the back of a single break, Djokovic found the going a bit tougher in the next as the big-serving Hurkacz raised his game in search of a first win over the world number one in their fifth meeting.

After a crucial hold from 0-30 down to draw level at 5-5, Djokovic grabbed another break to heap the pressure on Hurkacz and the five-times champion closed out the match on serve.

""It was a challenging match as it always is against Hubert,"" Djokovic said. ""I think he's got one of the best serves in the game. In the second set, until the 11th game I didn't have too many chances against his serve.

""Fortunately for me, I also found the rhythm on my serve... one or two points can decide the winner in matches like these.

""I'm really glad with the way I played under pressure.""

Up next for Djokovic is a meeting with former world number one Daniil Medvedev, who beat Borna Coric 6-3 6-2.

Alexander Zverev earlier reached his first semi-final since last year's French Open with a 7-5 6-4 win over Lorenzo Sonego.

The seventh seed has had a torrid time after injuring his ankle at Roland Garros and undergoing surgery, only returning to the ATP tour in December after suffering a bone edema problem during his rehabilitation.

""It's been a very difficult time for me over the last nine months,"" world number 16 Zverev said. ""I haven't played tennis at all for such a long period for the first time in my life.

""It definitely shows that the hard work is paying off and I'm extremely happy with my progress and how I'm playing right now. I'm happy to be in my first semi-final since the injury.

""Hopefully it won't be my last and hopefully there's much more to come here.""

Zverev next plays defending champion Andrey Rublev after the combustible Russian overcame a late wobble to get past Botic van de Zandschulp 6-3 7-6(3).

Zverev has won each of their five meetings, including their last one in the 2021 Cincinnati final.

""It's going to be tough,"" Rublev said. ""I have to play good, aggressive tennis."""
4,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/south-africas-pistorius-parole-girlfriends-murder-3319566,"JOHANNESBURG: South African Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorius, who killed his girlfriend 10 years ago, will know in about a month whether he will be released on parole, his lawyer said on Thursday (Mar 2).

""We have been advised by the parole board that (the) hearing will take place on the 31st of March, 2023,"" his lawyer Julian Knight told AFP. ""It's an internal process"".

Pistorius, 36, shot dead Reeva Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 when he fired four times through the bathroom door of his ultra-secure Pretoria house.

He pleaded not guilty and denied that he killed Steenkamp in a rage, saying he mistook her for a burglar.

Pistorius, known worldwide as the ""Blade Runner"" because of his carbon-fibre prosthetics, was sentenced to 13 years behind bars.

Offenders in South Africa are automatically eligible for parole consideration after serving half of their sentence. Pistorius has served more than half.

A decision is usually known the same day of the parole hearing or a day later, and ""if the decision is negative, the offender has the right to approach the courts for review,"" said Knight.

A year before killing Steenkamp, Pistorius became the first double-amputee to race at the Olympics at the London 2012 games.

He was initially sentenced to six years in jail but the sentence was later lengthened to 13 after the state appealed that it was unduly lenient."
6,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/alonso-privileged-have-raced-longer-piastris-age-3320381,"MANAMA: Oscar Piastri was not yet born when Fernando Alonso made his Formula One debut and both said on Thursday (Mar 2) they felt privileged at the prospect of racing each other in Sunday's Bahrain season-opener.

Aston Martin driver Alonso's first appearance for now-defunct Minardi was the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on Mar 4, 2001. Piastri was born in the same city on April 6 of that year.

While Piastri makes his debut, the race will be Alonso's record-extending 356th F1 start.

""Privileged to still drive here, better than ever. I have no concerns on age yet,"" Alonso, 41, told reporters at the Sakhir circuit with Piastri sitting in the same FIA press conference for the first time as a Formula One driver.

Piastri, who was reserve to Alonso at Renault-owned Alpine last season, returned the compliment.

""It's a privilege to race against Fernando obviously. I grew up watching him. My first go-kart ever was a Fernando Alonso kart, actually,"" he said.

""On paper, it sounds a little bit strange ... for Fernando's career to be longer than I've been alive but it's a big privilege to race against someone like Fernando.""

Alonso pointed out that Ferrari's Carlos Sainz, McLaren's Lando Norris and former F1 racer Daniil Kvyat had also started out with one of his karts.

Asked how many years he felt he had left to win a third title, Alonso said: ""I don't know. Eight? 10?

When asked to ""be honest"", he replied: ""five"".

Piastri is one of three rookies this season, although AlphaTauri's Nyck de Vries actually made his F1 debut at Monza last year as replacement for Alex Albon at Williams.

The first race of the season is a tense time for all drivers, but all three played down any jitters ahead of their big weekend.

""I feel comfortable in the car. I feel like I've laid a good foundation and a base to work from so I'm relatively relaxed heading into tomorrow,"" said Williams' US newcomer Logan Sargeant."
7,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/unwanted-record-bavuma-test-debut-triumph-3320041,"PRETORIA: Winning skipper Temba Bavuma will have mixed emotions about the start of his test captaincy after South Africa beat the West Indies in the first test at Centurion on Thursday but the diminutive batsman joined an unwanted club.

Bavuma, 32, was installed as the new test skipper just weeks before the two-test series when Dean Elgar was stripped of the job after heavy defeats in both England and Australia over the last six months for South Africa.

But while Bavuma led his side to a comfortable 87-run win over the West Indies on Thursday, his own performance left much to be desired.

He earned the unwanted distinction of becoming the fourth player to get a pair of ducks on his test captaincy debut after Mark Taylor (Australia), Rashid Latif (Pakistan) and Habibul Bashar (Bangladesh).

Bavuma was dismissed second ball in the first innings and first ball in the second innings, which will fuel the debate over his place in the team and continuing to select a batsman who has scored a single century in 95 test innings.

But he was not the only failure with the bat as South Africa, who had won the toss, elected to bat and score 342 in the first innings only to wilt in the second innings and make 116.

It set the West Indies a target of 247 runs but they fell well short as the pace bowlers dominated the contest.

“We did not get many partnerships. The wicket did not get easier, there was variable bounce,” said Bavuma.

“But our lead eventually proved to be a lot. The bowlers need to rest, it was a big effort from them. The batters need to get together and work on our game plan. We need to do better next time,” he said after the victory.

Kagiso Rabada’s six wicket haul in the second innings ensured victory inside three days for South Africa.

“It wasn't the best wicket,” said the South African paceman, “but we made sure to keep up a good intensity and do well.”"
8,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/f1-duty-bound-raise-awareness-says-hamilton-3320161,"MANAMA: Formula One has to draw attention to issues in the countries it visits, Lewis Hamilton said in Bahrain on Thursday (Mar 2) as drivers began a new season with tighter rules on what they can say.

The seven times world champion was asked about human rights in Bahrain and neighbouring Saudi Arabia, which hosts the second round.

It was the first time he had faced the media at a grand prix since the re-wording of the international sporting code last December to require written permission to make or display ""political, religious and personal statements or comments"".

The new rules cover podium ceremonies and anthems but drivers can make statements ""in their own space"" such as social media and official news conferences in response to direct questions.

Hamilton has said nothing will stop him speaking out.

""I’ve always felt that we have a responsibility and if the sport is going to go to these countries we are duty bound to raise awareness and try to leave a positive impact in these places,"" he told reporters in the Mercedes hospitality at Sakhir.

""That view has not always been shared within the sport, whether its teams or people in high-powered positions, but more needs to be done without doubt.

""Whether or not that will happen, time will tell.""

Asked about the human rights situation in Bahrain and Formula One's impact, he said he was ""not sure it’s got better while I’ve been coming all these years.""

The Briton was speaking in a crowded room with only three female reporters among the men - an imbalance he was also happy to speak out on.

""This sport still has a lot more work to do in the diversity space,"" he said when asked about the general absence of female figures in the latest run of the popular Netflix docu-series 'Drive to Survive'.

""It’s definitely not good ... there are a lot of women out there that are watching Drive to Survive that are watching the sport.

""If they are not seeing that it’s possible for them to be there, or there’s a place for them there, that’s counter-intuitive to our values and what should be. It is still very much a male-dominated space,"" he added.

""I'm trying to get 8,000 girls into the sport. We need everybody to be doing that up and down the pitlane because 100 per cent girls and women belong here equally as much as the men do."""
9,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/hamilton-calls-out-hill-and-button-over-contract-comments-3320056,"MANAMA: Lewis Hamilton has hit back at fellow Formula One champions Damon Hill and Jenson Button for suggesting he was holding off on a new deal until he knew how competitive his Mercedes was.

The sport's most successful driver of all time, now 38, is out of contract at the end of the season that starts in Bahrain on Sunday but has said a new deal will be done.

Hill, the 1996 world champion, wrote in a recent column for the Daily Telegraph newspaper that Hamilton might be ""less-minded to sign a new long-term deal"" if the car were miles off the pace.

Button, 2009 champion, was quoted by the Independent as saying his fellow-Briton could be tempted to retire if the wins dried up.

Seven times champion Hamilton told reporters at Sakhir on Thursday that ""it's ultimately people creating rumours without facts.

""It's never helpful, and you would have thought that they would both know me by now,"" he added.

""I have been with Mercedes since I was 13... and whether or not we have a difficult year this year, I will still be here. I am a fighter and we fight as a team.

""I love the challenge of finding solutions and I still believe I am able to put the car in places that perhaps others are not able to.

""There is no hold up with our contract, I've always been very relaxed. I don't feel like I have to get it done right this second.""

Red Bull's double world champion Max Verstappen is chasing his third successive title and his car looked comfortably quicker than the rest in testing last week.

The Dutch 25-year-old was asked on Thursday where the new car was better than the one that won 17 of 22 races last year and replied: ""everywhere"".

Mercedes are confident they have fixed the 'porpoising' problems that troubled them last year but remain off the pace.

Hamilton said the team had dived deep into the data and he had been involved on calls every day.

""I knew from the moment I drove the car where we were and the challenges we would be facing,"" he said.

""On a positive, not having the bouncing this year is a huge plus ... now we can focus on just pure performance."""
10,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/barcelona-renegotiate-deal-finance-stadium-revamp-3320101,"MADRID: Barcelona are renegotiating the terms of a €1.5 billion (US$1.59 billion) financial plan with Goldman Sachs to revamp their stadium and may have to repay the debt five years earlier than anticipated, according to a rating agency and a high-level club source.

Barcelona approved a 35-year debt plan in a referendum of club members in 2021 that would enable them to renovate their iconic but languishing Camp Nou stadium and its surroundings.

The preliminary debt structure has been revised, the Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) said in reports published on its website, with Barca to make a final repayment in 2047 instead of 2052 as previously agreed..

The original plan represented the only source of funding for the Nou Camp project. Under the amended structure, notes would be issued for €1.3 billion, with the remainder of the deal made up of a 200 million euros bank loan maturing in 2028, the KBRA report said.

KBRA said the revised structure included additional refinancing and interest rate risk and as a result it had downgraded the financing plan's rating from BBB+ to BBB, meaning it is less attractive to investors.

A source at the club confirmed the revised debt structure but said the terms of the deal were still being negotiated with Goldman Sachs and that the definitive deal would be announced by Mar 31.

Goldman Sachs has not replied to a request for more information about the ongoing talks and the new terms.

Camp Nou is the largest football stadium in Europe and the fourth largest in the world by capacity with 99,354 seats but the club considers it no longer offers a full match-day experience for fans.

The club estimates the new stadium will allow Barca to generate 200 million euros of additional revenue annually through sponsorship and naming rights, ticketing, catering, VIP boxes, hospitality, meetings and events.

Barcelona have announced that Turkish construction company Limak will carry out the renovation and work will start in June.

Club president Joan Laporta, who presided over one of Barca's most successful periods from 2003 to 2010, was re-elected two years ago after the previous board resigned due to the club's worsening finances and other issues.

He inherited a club deep in a financial crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Restricted by LaLiga's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, Barca were unable to agree a new deal with club great Lionel Messi, who left as a free agent to Paris St Germain in 2021.

Since then Laporta has tried to improve the club's financial situation, turning the club's assets into cash and bringing in new sponsors.

In March 2022, the club signed a shirt and stadium sponsorship deal with audio streaming platform Spotify (SPOT.N) in an agreement worth 280 million euros.

Barca have also agreed to sell a 25 per cent stake in their La Liga TV rights for the next 25 years to US private equity group Sixth Street for 607.5 million euros and approved the sale of a minority share of their audio-visual division to Socios.com and Orpheus Media for 200 million."

Brook has notched four centuries and amassed 809 runs in only six tests, flourishing in England's aggressive approach to the game, which has been dubbed 'Bazball' in a nod to coach Brendon McCullum.

The 24-year-old will try his hand at hitting home runs at the Cardinals camp in Florida as part of a new ambassadorial role with MLB Europe.

""I'm intrigued to see how different it is to cricket and what similarities there are too - will a home run feel as good as hitting a six?"" Brook said in an MLB news release on Thursday.

""I'm also excited to learn from how other professional sportspeople go about their game and see if there are any transferable skills between batting in baseball and cricket.""

England fast bowler Issy Wong, 20, was also named an MLB Europe ambassador.

The Cardinals will face the Chicago Cubs in a two-game series at the London Stadium on June 24 and 25."
13,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/czech-olympian-nash-cleared-doping-after-dog-medicine-defence-3321131,"Veteran Czech cyclist Katerina Nash has avoided a four-year ban after a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) investigation determined the five-time Olympian's positive test had been a result of administering medicine to her pet dog.

Nash, 45, tested positive for the appetite stimulant capromorelin after providing an out-of-competition urine sample on Oct. 24 2022, USADA said.

Capromorelin is not specifically listed on WADA's ""Prohibited List"" but is considered by the global anti-doping body to be a non-specified substance in the class of peptide hormones, growth factors, related substances and mimetics.

It is banned at all times under USADA and International Cycling Union anti-doping protocols.

California-based Nash provided records of a prescription liquid pet medication containing capromorelin.

""She was administering the medication orally to her dog each day during the final weeks of her pet’s life in an effort to maintain weight,"" USADA said in a statement.

Due to the difficulty of administering the medication Nash came into contact with it via her hands. The bottle did not warn users about the risk of contamination from exposure to skin.

Working with lab experts USADA established that such exposure would cause a positive test, the agency said.

It therefore concluded Nash had no fault or negligence and would not be sanctioned.

If she had not been cleared, Nash, who competed as a skier at two winter Olympics before switching to cycling, faced a four-year ban.

""As in this case, we always work as hard to try to exonerate the truly innocent as we do to convict those who intentionally cheat,"" said USADA boss Travis Tygart.

USADA disclosed Nash's no-fault violation in keeping with WADA rules but Tygart said the rules needed to change.

""If there is no question that an athlete comes into contact with a prohibited substance from a completely innocent source and there is no effect on performance, USADA continues to advocate that there should not be a violation or a public announcement,” he said.

""The rules must change and all of us must wake up and demand a more fair and just global anti-doping system that catches and sanctions intentional cheats who rob clean athletes but does not railroad innocent athletes."""

Gerry Cardinale, the founder of RedBird Capital, was asked about reports that banks and investment funds were keen to acquire a share of Serie A's media rights operation.

""I'm not a buyer of that, I'm not a supporter of that,"" he told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit.

""Why mortgage your future?,"" added the former Goldman Sachs banker. ""We can be self-sufficent ourselves.""

Serie A's key media business has drawn interest from a number of banks and investment funds and its clubs are due to meet later this month to consider their next step.

Germany's Bundesliga is also pursuing a similar strategy as continental clubs look at ways to close the revenue gap on the English Premier League.

RedBird bought Italian soccer champions AC Milan last August in a €1.2 billion deal that also involved the owners of the New York Yankees baseball team."
17,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/english-clubs-spending-more-after-brexit-changed-immigration-system-masters-3320401,"LONDON : The new visa system put in place after Brexit is a contributory factor to Premier League clubs spending record sums on transfer fees as they find it more difficult to sign players at a younger age, the league's chief executive Richard Masters said on Thursday.

A UEFA report published last month showed the January transfer window was dominated by English clubs who spent a total of 830 million euros ($878 million) which accounted for 53 per cent of global transfer spending.

English clubs cannot sign Europe-based players under the age of 18, however, and Masters said at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London that the immigration system ""needs a bit of a tweak"".

""Whilst we're totally committed to developing young, homegrown players and we want (England manager) Gareth Southgate to be successful... when you have a limited supply of players you can go for and you've got lots of demand, then it's slightly inflationary,"" Masters said.

""That's certainly not the only reason why lots of money and records are being broken in the Premier League transfer window, but it's a contributing factor.""

The UK Home Office has a points-based Government Body Endorsement (GBE) system based on which clubs must apply to England's Football Association to sign players.

""Ultimately we have generated an earned advantage over our European investors and a lot of that earned advantage goes to those European investors in transfer fees for players that we can no longer buy at a younger age,"" Masters added.

""Some of this has nothing to do with the GBE system. It's just that if you're outside Europe, we can't buy younger players in the same way that you could before, but it's partially to do with the GBE system.""

BIGGEST SPENDERS

Chelsea were the biggest spenders having laid out more than 500 million pounds ($596 million) in two windows since an investment group led by American Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital took over the club in May last year.

Their massive outlay of nearly 300 million pounds on eight players in January - which included the 106.8 million-pound signing of Enzo Fernandez - was more than the combined totals of all clubs in the Bundesliga, LaLiga, Serie A and Ligue 1.

Their spending raised questions on how they would comply with Financial Fair Play regulations but Masters said they needed to be judged over a period of time.

""I'm not here to defend the new owners who have owned the club for less than a year and had two transfer windows,"" Masters said.

""They might have bought, but they would probably argue they have a different transfer policy to the previous regime with younger players, longer contracts and lower wages.

""Within our rules it's a test over a 12-month period, so the question is whether they are going to sell some of their existing players in the next window.""

The RFU announced in January that tackling above the waist will be banned in the community game from next season to reduce head impact exposure and concussion risk.

After the guidelines were met with widespread criticism, the RFU apologised for causing ""anger and concern"".

""The RFU is seeking the support of the community game to implement change in a way that ensures rugby remains the sport we all know and love,"" the RFU said in a statement on Thursday.

""In addition to the survey, there will also be a series of online and face-to-face consultations across the country. The RFU has been working with constituent bodies to ensure the consultation reaches a broad and representative cross-section of people...

The RFU added that changing the tackle height is ""an important step in reducing the risk of concussion"" and that it is backed by a ""large body of scientific evidence"".

A threatening hand-written message for 35-year-old Messi, Argentina's captain and seven-times World Player of the Year, was also left on the shop door.

""Messi, we are waiting for you, (Pablo) Javkin (the mayor) is also a narco, he is not going to take care of you,"" it read.

Javkin blamed the security forces for failing to effectively combat organized crime, which in recent years has grown in the important port city, where dozens of ships daily load thousands of tons of grain.

""I spoke (with the Roccuzzos) and they are worried,"" Javkin told reporters outside the supermarket that was attacked.

Television images showed bullet casings on the sidewalk where the business belonging to Roccuzzo's family is located. The front of the building was hit by 14 bullets and the shop remained closed on Thursday morning.

Santa Fe's Security Minister Claudio Brilloni told reporters that authorities did not have any firm assumptions regarding the motives for the attack. Prosecutor Federico Rébola said the Roccuzzo family had not received any previous threats, a Rosario media outlet reported.

On the official Twitter account ""Team Messi"" and Antonela Roccuzzo's Instagram profile there were no mentions of the incidents.

The murder rate in Rosario is among the highest in Argentina, as gangs linked to drug trafficking coexist, according to judicial complaints, and clashes causing injuries and deaths are frequently reported.

The attack came weeks before Argentina play two friendly matches in the South American country, three months after Messi led the team to victory in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Neither game will take place in Rosario. Argentina face Panama on March 23 in the capital Buenos Aires and on Mar 28 they play in the province of Santiago del Estero against Curacao.

Newcastle's takeover by a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) was rubber-stamped in October 2021 after ""legally binding assurances"" that the Saudi government would have no control of the north-east club.

However, a U.S. court case concerning the PGA Tour and LIV golf this week described Newcastle chairman and PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan as a ""sitting minister of the government,"" casting doubt on the independence of the club's ownership.

""The Premier League will surely need to re-examine the assurances made about the non-involvement of the Saudi authorities in the Newcastle deal, not least as there's still a Qatari bid for Manchester United currently on the table,"" said Peter Frankental, Amnesty's UK economic affairs director.

Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani, a member of the Qatar royal family, is fronting one of the two groups who are seeking a full takeover of Manchester United.

The brief filed in the PGA Tour case against LIV Golf described the Public Investment Fund as ""a sovereign instrumentality of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.""

PIF is chaired by Saudi Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman. Six of the other eight board members are Saudi government ministers, according to PIF's website, while one is Advisor at the Royal Court and Al Rumayyan is Governor of the PIF.

""It was always stretching credulity to breaking point to imagine that the Saudi state wasn't directing the buyout of Newcastle with the ultimate aim of using the club as a component in its wider sportswashing efforts,"" Amnesty's Frankental was quoted as saying by the BBC.

""There's an unmistakable irony in the sovereign wealth fund declaration emerging in a dispute about another arm of Saudi Arabia's growing sports empire, but the simple fact is that Saudi sportswashing is affecting numerous sports and governing bodies need to respond to it far more effectively.""

LIV Golf and the PGA Tour have been in litigation since several LIV players filed federal antitrust lawsuits last August.

The description of Al-Rumayyan as a sitting minister of government came from lawyers representing LIV Golf, which is owned by the PIF.

:Runaway leaders Napoli will look to extend their eight-match winning run in Serie A when they host Lazio on Friday but face a stern test against the second-best defence in the league.

Lazio climbed back into the fourth and the final Champions League spot after beating visiting Sampdoria 1-0 on Monday but they will not find it easy against a Napoli side who have kept four consecutive clean sheets while scoring 10 goals.

Napoli have one hand on the title with an 18-point lead over second-placed Inter Milan and manager Luciano Spalletti has nothing but praise for his team as they look to end a 33-year wait for the Serie A title with 14 games left.

""Everyone we face seems to be playing for their lives and if we're where we are at this stage of the season it means I have a group of lads who know how to handle every game the right way,"" he said.

""(They are) displaying the mindset and the spirit you need as a squad if you want to come out on top in every game.""

Juventus are on the rise again after a 15-point deduction related to the club's transfer dealings saw them plunge from third to 10th place. Four wins in a row have lifted them to seventh in the table ahead of their visit to Roma on Sunday.

Massimiliano Allegri's side are six points behind sixth-placed Atalanta, who occupy the last European slot, and have been boosted by the return from injury of Paul Pogba.

The France midifelder came off the bench to make his first appearance in his second stint since his return to Juve in Tuesday's 4-2 home win over Torino.

Roma will be without manager Jose Mourinho after the Portuguese coach was banned for two games and fined 10,000 euros ($10,628) for his explosive reaction to being sent off in his side's 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Cremonese.

IBRAHIMOVIC RETURNReigning champions AC Milan bounced back from four straight losses in all competitions to win four on the trot without conceding and Stefano Pioli's side can move up to second place with another win if Inter drop points at home to Lecce.

Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic is back in the Milan squad after a lengthy injury layoff and the striker might even make his first start of the season on Saturday at Fiorentina, against whom he has scored 11 times in Serie A.

If he finds the net, the 41-year-old will set the record as the oldest scorer in the history of the competition, overtaking former Milan player Alessandro Costacurta.

Udinese visit Atalanta on Saturday and will attempt to break the home side's 10-match unbeaten run against them in Serie A.

Inter have won each of their last eight home games against Lecce in Serie A, but manager Simone Inzaghi has warned about the impact of their unforgiving schedule.

""We can’t seem to maintain the same level of concentration and determination playing every two and a half days,"" he said after Sunday's 1-0 loss at Bologna.
