On a freezing night in north London the Italians comfortably protected the slender advantage they established in the first leg of their last-16 tie at the San Siro as Tottenham huffed and puffed to little effect and exited with a whimper.

Tottenham failed to muster an attempt on target in the first half as their frustration boiled over with manager Antonio Conte booked for letting his emotions get the better of him while they had defender Cristian Romero sent off late on.

Milan could have made it a more comfortable night had they taken any of the good chances they created but in the end a masterclass of game management saw them through.

While Stefano Pioli's Milan can look forward with optimism, Tottenham's season is fizzling out after a dismal week in which they also lost in the FA Cup to second-tier Sheffield United and to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League.

Milan may be some way off returning to their European pomp but while they lack the household names of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Pioli's team had too much craft for a meek Tottenham side who were booed at the final whistle.

""We knew it would be tough, but we managed. I asked the players to show character. We never gave up, and we deserved to progress,"" Pioli said. ""We made it to the quarters, now let's see what happens in the draw.""

THIRD GEAR

The match kicked off 10 minutes late because of traffic issues and in truth Tottenham never got out of third gear.

Considering it was flagged as their biggest game of the season there was a mystifying lack of urgency from the hosts in the first half in which they offered the home faithful nothing to warm their spirits.

Tottenham's three-man attack of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were forced to feed on scraps and while Milan were hardly any more potent they did have the first decent chance when Junior Messias drilled a shot wide.

The Italians came close to taking the lead just after the interval when the ball broke for first-leg scorer Brahim Diaz but his shot was blocked by the legs of Fraser Forster.

With the clock showing 64 minutes Tottenham finally warmed the gloves of Milan keeper Mike Maignan as Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, suspended for the first leg, fired in an angled drive that was parried over for a corner.

As Tottenham committed men forward gaps appeared at the back and Rafael Leao had an effort blocked and then sent another attempt over the crossbar.

Kane sent a stooping header wide as the game began to open up and Tottenham rolled the dice by sending on forward Richarlison in place of wing back Emerson.

Conte was then jeered for hauling off Kulusevski for defender Davinson Sanchez as time ran out.

Kane went close to levelling in stoppage time with a skidding header superbly saved by Maignan but Milan almost crowned their night on the counter-attack with substitute Divock Origi hitting the post in front of their already-celebrating fans."

The 33-year-old Choupo-Moting, who played for PSG from 2018-20, tapped in from a Leon Goretzka assist in the 61st minute.

Substitute Gnabry struck on the break in the 89th minute to seal the hosts' 3-0 aggregate win following their 1-0 victory in the first leg in Paris.

The result established Bayern as one of the title favourites going into the last eight and left PSG's star-studded squad including world champion Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe without a shot at Europe's premier club trophy for another year.

The quarter-final draw will take place on Mar 17.

PSG, without injured forward Neymar, were sharper in the early stages and went close through Mbappe and then a double effort from Messi in front of goal in the 25th minute.

Bayern gradually took the fight to the visitors and had a chance of their own when Musiala's 32nd-minute shot was blocked by keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.

Despite PSG captain Marquinhos being taken off with a rib injury in the 36th minute, the visitors almost went ahead two minutes later when under pressure Bayern keeper Yann Sommer lost possession in the box.

Vitinha's shot with the goal at his mercy was cleared on the line by Matthijs de Ligt in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the game.

The Dutch defender had made an almost identical stop against VfB Stuttgart in the league last week.

With Mbappe largely kept quiet, it was his in-form former PSG team mate Choupo-Moting who scored when he struck just past the hour for his 17th goal in all competitions this season.

He had gone close twice a few minutes earlier.

PSG attempted to bounce back instantly and had a Sergio Ramos header saved by Sommer two minutes after the goal. The Spaniard also headed wide a little later but their hopes were shattered when Gnabry completed a quick break in the 89th minute.

""The best team won,"" PSG's Danilo said. ""We missed a few chances, it's hard to swallow. They're a very physical side. I don't have words. If we want to improve we have to stick together."""

United, who top the standings on 35 points from 14 games, travel to Chelsea with a one-point lead, but the Blues have a game in hand and a victory for either side could give them a huge advantage as the title race hots up.

Norway international Reiten fired home a penalty low to the keeper's right to give Chelsea the lead in the 12th minute after Sam Kerr was fouled in the box, and Jess Carter doubled the home side's advantage nine minutes later.

Kerr fluffed her lines in the 67th minute, missing a great chance after Reiten threaded a beautiful ball through to her, but she made amends by setting up Rytting Kaneryd for a tap-in five minutes later, the Swede's first goal for the Blues.

Outclassed in the first half, Brighton battled back in the second and though substitute Danielle Carter scored late on, the defeat leaves them second from bottom in the table on eight points, two ahead of Leicester City.

In the evening's other game fourth-placed Arsenal, who beat Chelsea in the Women's League Cup final on Sunday, cruised to a 2-0 win over Liverpool, with Stina Blackstenius and Caitlin Foord netting the goals."

Milan claimed a 1-0 aggregate victory after a goalless draw on a freezing night in London as the hosts crashed out with a whimper.

""I like to think there’s nothing impossible in sport,"" Pioli said.

""Clearly, only the best in Europe remain, and each round gets more difficult, but I am sure that all the European experiences, especially the negative ones - help us step up a level.

""Now we must go into the quarter-final with confidence and belief.""

Milan have turned around an abysmal start to the year and are now in fifth place in Serie A, equal on points with AS Roma who are in the fourth and last place that gives Champions League football next season.

""It is wonderful to play in the Champions League, gratifying and important for Milan. So either we win it, which would not be easy, or try to qualify by finishing in the top four in Serie A,"" Pioli said.

Milan have booked their spot in the last eight with Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Benfica, while the remaining four teams will be decided next week.

""We’ll be paired with a great opponent, but Tottenham are a big team too and we can always have our say. It is good to dream. Now we need to focus on Serie A, where we have some lost ground to make up.""

The draw for the quarter-finals will be held on Mar 17."
7,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/contes-casts-doubt-spurs-future-champions-league-woes-go-3335751,"LONDON: Antonio Conte's dismal record in the Champions League continued as his Tottenham Hotspur side exited the competition in the last 16 after a dreary 0-0 draw at home to AC Milan on Wednesday (Mar 8).

Tottenham never really threatened to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the first leg and went out with a whimper and boos from the home fans whose patience is running out.

Conte returned to the technical area after missing the last four games following gallbladder surgery but was as subdued as his team on a freezing night in north London.

In six Champions League campaigns with Juventus, Inter Milan, Chelsea and Tottenham, the Italian has only managed to reach the Champions League quarter-finals once.

And with his contract up in June, Wednesday's defeat felt like the beginning of the end of an era even if his side remain in contention to finish in the Premier League top four.

Whether or not Conte remains for the rest of the season is not certain, judging by his comments to Italy's Amazon Prime.

""I continue to work, I have a contract with Tottenham. I respect the contract. At the end of the season, assessments will be made with the club in the most serene way,"" he said.

""Let's see how the season ends. Maybe they can send me away even earlier. Perhaps the expectations were higher and may be disappointed. What matters for a coach is trying to work and raise the bar. This year we are struggling to raise the bar.""

Conte tried to talk about Tottenham's last-16 exit as progress, arguing that last season they were in the Europa Conference League, but the fans are unlikely to agree.

""We played in the Europa Conference League last year and weren't able to get out of the group stages. Now we took a step forward but it is not enough and if we want to be competitive,"" he said. ""We have to fight.""

Tottenham have now failed to score in their last three games, losing in the FA Cup to second-tier Sheffield United, to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League and now barely laying a glove on an average Milan side.

In his news conference later, Conte said he was sorry for the fans but that the club needed to go ""step by step"".

""I think the situation is very clear. I always say the same things we need time and patience. We don't have solid foundations to fight and win,"" Conte, who dragged Tottenham into fourth place in the Premier League last season, told reporters.

""We can't make a miracle and I can understand the fans losing patience because for a long time Tottenham have not won anything,"" he said. ""I'm really sorry for the fans but we cannot invent the win. It's important to know this.

""We have to build step by step."""

Coach Christophe Galtier's star-studded team that includes striker Kylian Mbappe and world champion Lionel Messi failed to score against Bayern over two legs, losing 3-0 on aggregate and seeing their hopes of clinching Europe's top club trophy disappear for another year.

""It's a big disappointment,"" Galtier said. ""We have to deal with it and accept it. There's a lot of disappointment in the dressing room.""

""I don't know if it's a lesson to be learned, but there's a lot of frustration. If we'd scored first, it would have been different, but we didn't.""

PSG made a strong start and France forward Mbappe had an early opportunity before Messi went close with a double chance of his own in the 25th minute.

""We didn't open the scoring when we had the chance. We did well in the first half, we felt we could match our opponents, but we didn't put away our chances,"" said Galtier.

Instead it was Bayern who opened the scoring when Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting tapped-in in the 61st minute before a late second goal from Serge Gnabry sealed their win.

""We conceded what was a really stupid first goal at this level. Yes, there was pressure from Bayern, but sometimes you mustn't be ashamed to play it long to get over the pressing,"" Galtier said.

""When you're behind after an hour's play, it's difficult.""

His team's latest European failure - their fifth last-16 exit in seven years - adds pressure on Galtier, who refused to speculate on his future at the club.

""It's a big disappointment but we have to swallow it. It is too soon to talk about my future. I'm focused to the end of the season with a lot of energy and determination."""
9,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/arteta-wont-rush-jesus-back-arsenal-ahead-sporting-clash-3335561,"Arsenal's Gabriel Jesus will not be rushed back into action, manager Mikel Arteta said on Thursday (Mar 9), after the striker returned to training with the team.

Jesus, who has scored five goals and chipped in seven assists for Arsenal following his £45 million (US$53.30 million) move from Manchester City in July, has been sidelined since he sustained a knee injury at the World Cup with Brazil, having surgery in early December.

""We will try not to rush him back, we will try to make a fair assessment between what he needs and when is comfortable,"" Arteta told reporters on Wednesday, ahead of their match at Sporting in the Europa League round of 16 on Thursday.

""Everything is going well, he needs time as well to get himself that confidence and that physical state that is necessary to compete with a free mind and once he’s free to do that, we will throw him in.""

Arteta said that Fabio Vieira had been suffering from a sore throat but would be available to play against Sporting.

Kieran Tierney, Eddie Nketiah and Leandro Trossard were absent from Wednesday's training, but Arteta said they were available for the match.

""Let’s see how they evolve. Obviously, we’ve had a few issues in the last few days and I am trying to accommodate everybody and get everyone in the best possible condition for tomorrow,"" Arteta said.

The match will be the fifth meeting between the two teams in European competition, with Arsenal yet to lose or concede a goal.

""The best way to prepare for any competition is to win the previous match and have that confidence and that proper emotion to approach the next game,"" Arteta said.

""Their strength is the idea of the manager, which is very clear. He (Ruben Amorim) has been very successful over the past years.

""We watched many of their matches v Tottenham and the big teams in Portugal. They are a very competitive team with a clear game plan. We need to be at our best to win this match."""
10,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/dominant-rahm-headlines-stacked-field-players-championship-3335011,"Jon Rahm may have come back down to earth after a strong start to the year but he is still the hottest player going into this week's Players Championship where 2022 champion Cameron Smith will be a notable absentee given his decision to join LIV Golf.

Rahm is the first player since Johnny Miller in 1975 to win three times in a calendar year before March and will headline a loaded field at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, which includes 44 of the top 50 players in the world.

The Spaniard, who opened the season with six consecutive top-10 finishes before settling for a share of 39th last week at Bay Hill, has never missed the cut in five starts at The Players and had his best result in 2021 when he finished ninth.

World number one Rahm counts the 2021 US Open among his 10 wins on the PGA Tour, but the Spaniard is very eager to add a Players Championship title to his resume.

""I mean, winning this event is a big step forward to a Hall of Fame career,"" Rahm told reporters. ""You are The Players Champion. Arguably as close as you can get to being a major champion without officially being one.""

Among the other contenders at TPC Sawgrass, where the winner will get US$4.5 million from a purse of US$25 million, are reigning PGA Tour Player of the Year Scottie Scheffler and four-times major winner Rory McIlroy.

For Scheffler and McIlroy, who have both spent time atop the world rankings this year, a win this week is one of the many scenarios in which they can return to top spot in the rankings.

McIlroy arrives full of confidence after finishing runner-up at Bay Hill where during the final round the Northern Irishman carded successive bogeys from the 14th before a two-putt birdie at the par-five 16th kept his hopes alive.

""As much as I was disappointed that I didn't play the final five holes the way I wanted to, it was still a good week, and I feel like getting into contention last week and sort of having those feelings sets me up well for this week,"" said McIlroy.

2019 TRIUMPH

McIlroy, who will play the first two rounds of the PGA Tour's flagship event alongside fellow major winners Rahm and Scheffler, has four top-10s in 12 starts at The Players, including his 2019 triumph.

Scheffler, who returned to world number one for a week in February after his successful title defense at the Phoenix Open, finished in a share of fourth at Bay Hill where he was also the defending champion.

Max Homa finished in a share of 13th place last year at TPC Sawgrass and will be liking his chances in what will be his third Players start given he is one of two golfers with multiple titles on the PGA Tour this season.

""This place is really tricky, so I think confidence is a big part of the week. It's nice to have that,"" said Homa, who moved to a career-best seventh in the world rankings this week.

""It's kind of fun to arrive at a massive event and not feel like I'm tinkering with anything or trying to do anything different.""

While there will plenty of star power at TPC Sawgrass, one glaring absence will be British Open champion and world number five Smith, who has been banned indefinitely from playing in PGA Tour events after switching to LIV Golf.

Australian Smith is one of five players who finished inside the top-10 last year at TPC Sawgrass who have since fled to LIV Golf, a group that also includes runner-up Anirban Lahiri, Dustin Johnson, Paul Casey and Harold Varner III.

First-round action begins on Thursday."

In a civil complaint filed on Monday in a Florida state court in Martin County, Herman said she believes the agreement is ""invalid and unenforceable,"" according to her lawsuit. She did not accuse Woods specifically of harassment or assault in court papers.

""Because of the aggressive use of the Woods NDA against her by the defendant and the trust under his control, the plaintiff is unsure whether she may disclose, among other things, facts giving rise to various legal claims she believes she has,"" it added.

A spokesman for Woods did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a request for comment.

The complaint cited the Speak Out Act, a federal law signed by President Joe Biden in December 2022 that limits the enforcement of NDAs in cases of sexual harassment and assault.

In a cover sheet accompanying the complaint, her lawyer Benjamin Hodas checked ""yes"" as to whether the case involved allegations of sexual abuse. The cover sheet did not say who such allegations might concern.

Hodas did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Woods and Herman have not recently addressed the status of their relationship. The two have not been seen publicly together since August when they attended the US Open tennis tournament in New York."

It was a year ago at the tournament in the Southern California desert that the Pole began really to hit her stride amid a scorching 37-match winning streak.

Since then, the three-time Grand Slam champion has been the player to beat on tour.

""I feel like there is a little bit of a target on my back, which I didn't feel last year. So it's a different situation and I have to adjust to that,"" she told reporters at Indian Wells on Wednesday.

""On the other hand I've been number one for almost a year so I already have enough experience to deal with it.""

Learning to tune out the critics is another adjustment she has had to make.

The 21-year-old said she was taken aback by the negativity that came with her loss in the final of the Dubai Tennis Championships last month after she successfully defended her title in Doha.

""I lost in the final and people were surprised - not happy with the performance - and just critical,"" she said.

""It made me think that last year, before this huge streak and before winning all these tournaments, I would have been so happy with the result.

""But because of these comments right now, I felt like ooh, that's not enough. I'm trying not to read those kinds of things because I'm happy with the work I've put in and how I played in Doha and Dubai.""

She said it's an example of how the world around her has shifted.

""There is more pressure and expectation but I'm trying to deal with that the best way possible,"" she said.

""And I think I'm doing good."""

Commonwealth Sport Canada (CSC) announced on Wednesday the Alberta bid, centred around the province's two biggest cities Calgary and Edmonton, as the preferred candidate after Hamilton's bid collapsed.

Hamilton, which hosted the first Commonwealth Games in 1930, had been considered the frontrunner to stage the centennial Games but was unable to obtain the required government backing by the CSC's Feb. 13th deadline.

""If there is one thing athletes and the sporting world know well it is the road to great achievement is never an easy one but it is one worth embarking on,"" said CSC president Claire Carver-Dias, in making the announcement. ""It is my distinct pleasure to announce that Alberta has been selected as Commonwealth Sport Canada's preferred candidate to bid for the 2030 Commonwealth Games.""

The Alberta government will contribute up to $2 million and the city of Edmonton another $1 million to the bid but Roger Jackson, president and CEO of the Alberta 2030 Commonwealth Games Corporation, could not provide a budget for the multi-sport event.

The CSC said it expects to complete the feasibility study in August when a decision will be made on whether to submit a formal bid.

""We are not ready yet to express exactly what that (budget) might be,"" said Jackson. ""We will be working with our government partners to come to a conclusion as to whether or not we advance a bid.""

Calgary hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics but saw hopes of bringing the 2026 Winter Games back to the city dashed when citizens voted resoundingly against it in a plebiscite, something current mayor Jyoti Gondek would not rule out happening again.

""I don't know where things are going to land through the exploration so not sure yet it will require a plebiscite,"" said Gondek. ""I am really hopeful people will see the value of this type of investment.""

If Canada does not put forward a bid it would be another blow for the Commonwealth Games Federation that has struggled to land hosts.

Both the Alberta and Hamilton bids said they were unaware of any other country expressing interest.

Australia will have staged two of the last three Commonwealth Games when Victoria hosts in 2026.

Birmingham hosted the 2022 Games, coming to the rescue after Durban, South Africa was stripped of the event over financial concerns."

The show, which is filming at Indian Wells again this year, focuses on a group of up-and-coming players including Casper Ruud, Felix Auger Aliassime and Taylor Fritz and as they try to navigate the pressure-filled world of professional tennis.

""One lady came up to me at Publix in Florida and said, 'Me and my husband were watching you last night on the Netflix show',"" Ruud told reporters on Wednesday, the first day of main draw action at Indian Wells.

""But it's not crazy. I haven't been an overnight worldwide superstar.""

One episode follows Ruud's run to the final of last year's French Open and depicts a heated exchange between the Norwegian and the grounds crew after he was not allowed to practise due to forecasted rain.

""I was quite angry honestly because the court crew wouldn't let us warm up before the match,"" Ruud said.

""I don't know if it was good or not but Netflix was there catching it all. It was something I almost forgot had happened,"" he said.

""But it was a little bit funny also, looking back on what can happen sometimes for us. It's not always a smooth ride.""

Canada's Auger Aliassime feels the impact of the show most acutely in the U.S., where Netflix has its biggest market.

""Going to dinner or a grocery store, a lot more people are recognizing me and other players,"" he said.

""They say, 'I just watched your episode and I loved it'. Nice interactions with people who maybe were not tennis fans before.""

Fritz's episode documented his breakthrough victory in the Indian Wells final last year and while he was happy with how it turned out, he said it may have given the wrong impressions about the ankle injury he played through in the title match.

""I thought the episode was really great but there were a couple things that were missed,"" the American said.

""I think the episode made it seem that my injury was in the warm-up before my match but it was at the end of my semi-final and I only realized how bad it felt the next day after.""

Ruud said he kept boundaries up between himself and the crew which limited his screen time.

""I didn't invite Netflix to too many personal things,"" he said.

""Inviting them to my hotel room, or having my girlfriend Maria talk on camera, that's not something she is so comfortable with. So there are many things that we said no to.

""But it's been fun to be part of something Netflix has made together with (the Formula One) ""Drive to Survive"" and the golf series (""Full Swing"").

The Briton told reporters last week that Mercedes were on the wrong track before he finished fifth in Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix opener.

""Last year, there were things I told them. I said the issues that are with the car,"" Hamilton told BBC Radio 5 Live's Chequered Flag podcast.

""I've driven so many cars in my life so I know what a car needs. I know what a car doesn't need. I think it's really about accountability.

""It's about owning up and saying, 'Yeah, you know what? We didn't listen to you. It's not where it needs to be and we've got to work',"" he said.

""We've got to look into the balance through the corners, look at all the weak points, and just huddle up as a team. That's what we do.""

Hamilton is Formula One's most successful driver of all time, with a record 103 wins, but is out of contract at the end of the season.

The 38-year-old failed to win a race last year, a career first for a season, but has dismissed suggestions he might be holding off on a new deal until he knew how competitive his car was.

He told the BBC that there was still time for Mercedes, whose run of eight successive constructors' titles ended last year, to turn the situation around.

""We're still multi world champions, you know? It's just we haven't got it right this time. We didn't get it right last year. But that doesn't mean we can't get it right moving forwards,"" he said.

Team boss Toto Wolff acknowledged in Bahrain that Mercedes needed to rethink the car.

""I don't think this package is going to be competitive eventually,"" said the Austrian of a car that stands out for its slimmed-down sidepods in marked contrast to Red Bull's solution.

""We got it wrong last year, we thought we could fix it by sticking to this concept of car and it didn't work out,"" he added.

Red Bull's double world champion Max Verstappen won in Bahrain with Mexican Sergio Perez securing the one-two finish. Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso was third in a car powered by a Mercedes engine."

The man was serving a national stadium ban until 2026 imposed by the Dutch football association, but entered the ground with a ticket bought for him by a friend, PSV said.

He was also banned from being anywhere near the Philips Stadium when PSV play home matches for the next two years.

Sevilla lost the knockout stage playoff second leg 2-0 but advanced to the next round with a 3-2 aggregate victory over PSV.

European soccer's governing body UEFA is investigating the attack."

Bayern beat PSG 1-0 at Parc de Princes in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie where the German club's supporters displayed a banner that contained an expletive in a protest against high ticket prices for the match.

UEFA rules prohibit ""provocative messages that are of a political, ideological, religious or offensive nature.""

Bayern were also fined for crowd disturbances after masked supporters were seen clashing with the police and for letting off pyrotechnics.

PSG were fined 39,500 euros for blocking passageways at the Parc des Princes stadium, while their fans also lit fireworks."
28,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/bbcs-lineker-refuses-budge-conflict-ideals-3335106,"Gary Lineker was never booked in his 16-year playing career but the former England striker is in danger of being shown the red card by his employer, the BBC, for standing up for refugees trying to make their way to Britain.

Lineker has hosted the BBC's flagship football show Match of the Day for more than 20 years and the charismatic 62-year-old has never been afraid to voice his opinions about political issues like Brexit.

As the BBC's highest-paid employee, Lineker is the face of its sports coverage.

Although the corporation has strict impartiality guidelines, that has not stopped Lineker from airing his views on Twitter where he has over 8.7 million followers.

Matters came to a head on Tuesday when Britain's interior minister Suella Braverman outlined proposals to stop almost all migrants crossing the Channel. Lineker described the policy as ""beyond awful"" and ""immeasurably cruel"".

Lineker wrote on Twitter that the language used in the proposals was not dissimilar to that of Nazi Germany, forcing the BBC to have a ""frank conversation"" with the presenter after Braverman's complaint.

Lineker doubled down on Wednesday, saying he would continue to speak for those who had no voice.

""I have never known such love and support in my life than I'm getting this morning (England World Cup goals aside, possibly). I want to thank each and every one of you,"" he added on Twitter.

Reuters has contacted the BBC for comment.

PROLIFIC STRIKER

As a footballer, Lineker's poaching instincts made him one of the most prolific strikers in the game, although major silverware eluded him.

He made his professional debut for Leicester City in 1978-79 and went on to make over 500 club appearances for the Foxes, Everton, Barcelona, Tottenham Hotspur and Japanese side Nagoya Grampus Eight, scoring nearly 300 goals.

He earned his first England cap in 1984 and by the time he retired was the country's second-highest scorer with 48 goals, behind Bobby Charlton. Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane have since overtaken both.

Lineker played 80 times for his country and his four goals at the 1990 World Cup despite being unwell propelled England to the semi-finals.

Having also top-scored at the 1986 World Cup with six goals, no English player has come close to eclipsing his record of 10 goals at football's global showpiece event, earning him a spot in English Football's Hall of Fame.

Following his retirement, Lineker embarked on a media career, working as a football pundit before taking over as Match of the Day host while also writing columns for British newspapers.

Midway through the 2015-16 campaign, Lineker went viral on social media when he promised to present Match of the Day wearing just his underwear if his former club Leicester went on to win the Premier League title.

Leicester beat overwhelming odds to lift the trophy and Lineker duly kept his word, presenting the first Match of the Day of the following season wearing nothing but white boxer shorts."
30,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/ive-been-subject-smear-campaign-says-france-womens-coach-diacre-3334861,"Amid reports of opposition from players and uncertainty over her future as France women's coach, Corinne Diacre said on Wednesday she has been the subject of a violent ""smear campaign"" ahead of this year's World Cup.

Former France captain Wendie Renard said last month she would not play in the World Cup. French multimedia outlet RMC Sport reported that Renard said she would not represent the national side as long as Diacre is in charge.

Fellow internationals Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Kadidiatou Diani have also said they were taking a step back from the national team.

Renard was stripped of the France captaincy by Diacre following the side's quarter-final exit at Euro 2017, before regaining it in 2021.

""... I have been the subject of a smear campaign that is astonishing in its violence and dishonesty,"" Diacre said in a statement issued by her lawyer.

""My detractors have not hesitated to attack my personal and professional integrity, without bothering with the truth, four months before the World Cup.

""I will not let myself be affected by this destabilisation operation, which does not take into account my sporting record, and which has as its sole objective a personal settlement of scores.""

The French Football Federation (FFF) did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

According to French media reports, Diacre's future may be decided on Thursday by an FFF select committee.

Diacre said she had appeared before an FFF commission and thanked its members for allowing her to ""dispel lies"".

""I am fully determined to carry out my mission and, above all, to do France proud at the next World Cup,"" she added.

The World Cup, co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia, will take place from Jul 20 to Aug 20.

France have been drawn in Group F alongside Jamaica, Brazil and Panama. They begin their campaign on July 23 against Jamaica.

They are not the only team to be experiencing issues in the build-up to the World Cup.

Canada were in dispute with their national federation over pay equity issues before reaching an interim funding agreement with Canada Soccer and 15 Spain players have been frozen out of the team over a revolt against their coach."

Haiti, Morocco, Panama, Philippines, Portugal, Ireland, Vietnam and Zambia will debut at the global women's soccer showcase that runs from Jul 20-Aug 20 in Australia and New Zealand.

""Seeing you ladies who are mothers, sisters, students and athletes. Women they identify with, excelling on the pitch,"" Samoura said in a statement.

""This will encourage a generation of young girls and women to aim high, to aim big. To advocate for themselves and to take themselves beyond greatness, on the pitch but also, in life.""

Several other sports figures championed women and applauded progress on International Women's Day, which has its roots in the US socialist and labour movements of the early 20th century when many women were fighting for better working conditions and the right to vote.

England's Lionesses cheered a UK government pledge that every girl in Britain will have equal access to soccer in school - a cause the national women's team had been supporting since capturing the Euro 2022 title last August.

Schools will be expected to deliver a minimum of two hours of PE (physical education) per week and ensure that girls have equal access to all school sport, including soccer.

""An announcement that will change women's football in England forever, and the start of something truly special,"" the Lionesses said in a statement. ""We see this as only the beginning.""

Hayley Wickenheiser, a four-time Olympic hockey champion for Canada, praised her parents in a celebratory Instagram post.

""My mom was an amazing female role model who advocated for women's rights, and my dad an amazing male role model who believed a little girl could do anything a little boy could do,"" she said. ""They were a big reason I was able to break down barriers and finish medical school.""

International Tennis Federation president David Haggerty called on men to step up in the fight for gender equality.

""The role of men cannot be underestimated,"" Haggerty said in a statement. ""It is our combined duty and responsibility to work out the best way to redress gender imbalance.""

The ITF launched the Men as Allies programme, an element of the ITF Advantage All gender equality strategy.

""It's time to start championing the champions,"" said Haggerty, who is a United Nations HeForShe Champion. ""We invite male leaders across all aspects of tennis to become Advantage All Male Allies.""

According to the ITF, allies will be expected to commit to make a tangible contribution toward gender equality goals.

Sebastian Coe championed female leadership in a Twitter video, saying having women in positions of influence makes for a better organisation.

Adding that ""I'll be maybe a little controversial,"" Coe suggested that if World Athletics had more women in leadership positions during some of the organization's darker years of the past, the challenges might not have been so profound."

Parker's sacking after a little over two months in the job was confirmed in a short news release.

""Scott Parker is no longer head coach of Club Brugge,"" Brugge said in a statement. ""The ex-England international previously worked for Fulham and Bournemouth and replaced Carl Hoefkens. In 12 games, the Briton could only win two times.""
