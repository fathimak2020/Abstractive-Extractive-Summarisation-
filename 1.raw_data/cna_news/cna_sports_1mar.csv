""After careful consideration with my team, I have decided to pull out of the SEA Games,"" the 27-year-old swimmer said in a statement.

""This was not an easy decision, but I am currently not at the level at which I hold myself to perform. Ultimately, my country comes first before individual accolades.""

The Olympic champion added that he would instead focus on his National Service duties and support his team-mates from home.

""I have decided to give my spot to team-mates who have been getting themselves ready and considered for selection while I cheer from home and focus on my Navy duties,"" he said.

The 2023 SEA Games will take place from May 5 to May 17 in Cambodia."

New Zealander Ko, who won her season-opener in Saudi Arabia last month to open up a comfortable lead at the top of the world rankings over American Korda, is chasing an elusive first title in Singapore, where a 2015 runner-up finish is her best result.

""You can never get too cocky about what ranked player you are because it's so tight at the top,"" Ko said this week.

""Everyone is playing really well and you can't say, 'I'm going to be there forever'.

""When I was younger, I felt like being number one meant that I had to be winning or contending week in, week out, but that's not necessarily true.""

Third-ranked Australian Minjee Lee is among last year's five major champions competing for the US$1.8 million prize purse in the 72-hole, no-cut event, while Ko Jin-young will be looking to defend her lone title of 2022 when play starts on Thursday (Mar 2).

The South Korean world number five, a twice major champion, was sidelined for much of last season with a wrist injury and missed back-to-back cuts for the first time in August. She tied for sixth in Thailand last week in her first start of 2023.

""I know there's going to be pressure but I don't want to think too much about it,"" she said. ""I just need to meditate as that has worked well for me in the past and has allowed me to focus more on my swing and golf shots.""

South Koreans have dominated the tournament dubbed ""Asia's major"", winning six of the last seven editions and seven of 14 overall since it was first held in 2008. The 2020 edition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Seven-times major winner Park In-bee, the only player to have won the title more than once, will not compete after announcing her pregnancy in December."
4,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/novak-djokovic-atp-tennis-world-rankings-number-1-3314351,"Novak Djokovic said his return to the top of the world rankings felt like a big achievement after a year of turmoil where he had to skip several tournaments including two Grand Slams, but the Serbian expects a see-sawing battle for the position in 2023.

Djokovic missed the 2022 Australian Open and was deported from the country due to being unvaccinated against COVID-19 before returning this year to clinch a record-extending 10th title at Melbourne Park and 22nd major to reclaim the number one spot.

He was forced out of big tournaments in the United States last year, including the US Open, as he was unable to enter the country due to his refusal to take his shots.

The 35-year-old also received no points for winning the Wimbledon title due to the grasscourt Grand Slam being penalised for its decision to ban players from Russia and Belarus over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

""I think this is the least points I've had as number one. It happens,"" Djokovic told reporters following his win over Tomas Machac in Dubai on Tuesday (Feb 28).

""It's not only due to my circumstances of not playing a couple of Grand Slams and everything that happened last year, but also other players, some players missing some slams for injuries, some not having the biggest consistency.

""I guess that makes the achievement bigger, at least in my team's and my eyes. I'm overwhelmed with pride. I work as hard as anybody else. I'm really committed to the sport. And I try.""

Djokovic is now into his 378th week as the world number one, surpassing Steffi Graf's record for the most weeks at the top of the sport.

But he said younger players like Carlos Alcaraz and Stefanos Tsitsipas will eventually catch up with him.

""These guys are playing at a high level constantly. They're playing a lot of tournaments. I'm not playing as much and don't plan to play as many weeks as they do,"" Djokovic said.

""Eventually they'll take the number one, then I'll bring it back again, then they'll take it again. We'll go in circles."""

Djokovic, who surpassed Steffi Graf's record for the most weeks as world number one after starting his 378th at the top of the rankings, moved with ease and showed no lingering effects of the hamstring tear he managed at Melbourne Park last month.

But there were some signs of rust especially on Djokovic's serve, which seemed to fail him midway through the opening set, before he regained control and took the early advantage in the match when Machac sent a return long.

The five-times Dubai champion was in a spot of bother while trailing 3-0 in the next set after dropping serve again and made 16 unforced errors to allow big-hitting Machac to take the contest into a decider.

Machac began to struggle with a right wrist issue early in the third set and Djokovic pounced for a 3-1 lead but the Czech mounted a comeback with a break of his own to level at 4-4 with some superb ball-striking along the way.

Machac blinked first in the tiebreak and Djokovic did not need another invitation as he finally quelled the world number 130 to extend his 2023 winning streak to 13 matches.

""Tomas didn't play like a world number 130. He played great tennis and deserves all the applause. He was giving me all kinds of trouble but when it mattered most I found another gear,"" Djokovic said.

""Physically I can be better. I demand the highest standards in quality of tennis and preparation. I have struggled with an injury and needed some time. But I'm hoping as the tournament progresses that I can raise the level of tennis as well.""

Djokovic next plays Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands.

Rotterdam and Doha champion Daniil Medvedev, the third seed, had earlier eased into the next round after dispatching Italian Matteo Arnaldi 6-4, 6-2.

Felix Auger-Aliassime had a tougher outing against American Maxime Cressy but the fourth seed prevailed 7-6(4), 3-6, 6-3 while Melbourne semi-finalist Karen Khachanov crashed to Botic van de Zandschulp who sealed a 7-5, 6-2 win."
7,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/top-seed-alcaraz-pulls-out-acapulco-strained-hamstring-3313636,"Top seed Carlos Alcaraz has pulled out of this week's ATP 500 event in Acapulco with a strained hamstring, the U.S. Open champion said on Tuesday.

The Spanish world number two, who was scheduled to play his opening match later on Tuesday, picked up the injury during his loss to Cameron Norrie in Sunday's Rio Open final where the pain hindered both his movement and serve.

""I have a grade 1 strain in my right hamstring that will keep me out for several days, according to the tests we did this morning,"" Alcaraz wrote on Twitter.

""I'm really sad I can't compete here, but now it's time to think about recovering and being ready as soon as possible. I hope to see you all soon!""

After spending more than three months out of action due to abdominal and hamstring injuries, Alcaraz returned to the ATP Tour in February at Buenos Aires where he beat Norrie in the final for his first title since last year's U.S. Open.

At the Rio Open, the 19-year-old Spaniard needed treatment for a left leg problem during his semi-final and then picked up an injury to the other leg in the match against Norrie during which he needed his leg wrapped midway through the final."
8,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/nadal-withdraws-indian-wells-and-miami-due-injury-3313111,"Rafa Nadal said on Tuesday he had decided to withdraw from two upcoming Masters 1000 hardcourt events in Indian Wells and Miami due to injury.

The 22-times Grand Slam champion, who has not competed since his Australian Open title defence ended in a second-round loss during which he aggravated a hip problem, said he had started rehab and physiotherapy as instructed by doctors.

""I am sad that I won't be able to compete at Indian Wells nor Miami. Very sad not to be there,"" read a message posted on Nadal's Twitter account. ""I'll miss all my US fans but I hope to see them later this year during the summer swing.""

Nadal lost in straight sets to Taylor Fritz in last year's Indian Wells final and then skipped the Miami Open so that he could focus on his claycourt preparation.

The 36-year-old Spaniard is a three-times champion at Indian Wells having triumphed in 2007, 2009 and 2013. Nadal has reached the Miami final five times but has never won the title and has not competed there since 2017.

""We wish Rafa continued healing, and hope to see him back at the BNP Paribas Open next year,"" Indian Wells tournament director Tommy Haas said in a statement.

At the Australian Open, top seed Nadal tweaked his left hip while running for a backhand in the second set at Rod Laver Arena, and after inspection from a trainer when trailing 6-4 5-3, he went off-court for a medical time-out.

The 22-times Grand Slam champion returned grim-faced to play out the match but his movement was clearly affected, paving the way for American Mackenzie McDonald to end the Spaniard's bid for a third title at Melbourne Park."

Foden struck in the seventh minute but it was not an entirely comfortable night for Pep Guardiola's side until the England forward's deflected effort made it 2-0 late on.

Kevin De Bruyne then gave the scoreline an emphatic look with a sublime finish from 25 metres although it was harsh on Bristol City who had been on a 12-match unbeaten run and pushed the Premier League champions hard.

Leicester were booed off after a 2-1 home defeat by second-tier Blackburn Rovers for whom Tyrhys Dolan and Sammie Szmodics were on target before a Kelechi Iheanacho reply.

Fulham reached the sixth round for the first time in 13 years with superb goals by Joao Palhinha and Manor Solomon earning them a 2-0 win over fellow top-flight side Leeds United.

Brighton and Hove Albion's hopes of a first ever major trophy remained intact as Evan Ferguson's first-half goal sealed a 1-0 win over second-tier Stoke City.

Guardiola named a strong side, as he invariably does in domestic cup competitions, and City began the game in dynamic style with Kalvin Phillips hitting the crossbar.

City did not have to wait long to take the lead though with Foden firing high into the roof of the net from Riyad Mahrez's pass across the face of goal.

The hosts did not buckle though and had a good shout for a penalty declined when Mark Sykes went down under a challenge from Rico Lewis in the area while Alex Scott forced a decent save from City keeper Stefan Ortega.

Bristol City, who were spared having to deal with rested Erling Haaland, were still very much in the game until De Bruyne split their defence with a ball to Nathan Ake whose pass eventually fell to Foden whose shot deflected into the net off of Zak Vyner.

""It was really tough. Bristol showed us how good they can be. I was impressed by some players, I didn't know them. The second half was much better,"" Guardiola said.

Promotion-chasing Blackburn thoroughly deserved their win at Leicester whose form remains wildly unpredictable.

""It's just consistency and mentality and ambition to succeed. That's been too up and down for us,"" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said.

""I'm really disappointed for the supporters. It's been a real challenge for them this season. The FA Cup was an opportunity to get to a quarter-final, against a Championship team at home, but they were a lot better than us, and we have to be worried about that.""

Fulham's magnificent season continues under Marco Silva with the Cottagers still chasing a European qualification spot on two fronts. They were not at their best against Leeds who had a host of chances and a goal disallowed but still showed their quality.

Palhinha struck a superb curled effort after winning the ball after 21 minutes and Israeli Solomon's 56th-minute goal was almost as impressive.

""It is great for us to go to the quarter-final,"" Silva, whose side are sixth in the Premier League, said.

""We know our story with the FA Cup is not great and we are here to try and change it.""

The remaining four fifth-round ties are on Wednesday with League Cup winners Manchester United at home to West Ham United.

Liverpool are seventh in the standings, nine points adrift of Tottenham Hotspur in fourth place, but Klopp's side have two games in hand, with arch rivals Manchester United visiting Anfield on Sunday.

Liverpool played Wolves twice in the FA Cup, winning the replay 1-0 before losing 3-0 in the reverse league fixture earlier this month and Klopp said he hoped to learn from their mistakes in that defeat.

""Nothing I saw in training suggests we don't have a chance. We know a lot about each other and we know it won't be easy. There won't be the most surprising information and we have to make sure we are ready,"" Klopp told reporters.

""It is a super important week, we cannot ignore that. We have two home games ... I would love to give the season a little push in this week and we need results for that. And for results we need good performances.

""The main difference is we will play at Anfield and we have to make that count. It's a long period between games, we want to put it right. But I am more focussed on giving the season a proper push, we need to find a steady mood.""

Liverpool still have several injuries, however, with influential midfielder Thiago Alcantara still sidelined with a hip problem while defender Joe Gomez is also ruled out with a muscle injury.

The club did receive a boost with Luis Diaz back in training after a knee injury but Klopp said the Colombian forward has not trained with the team yet.

Uruguayan striker Darwin Nunez is a doubt with a shoulder injury but Klopp said it was 'massive' to have former Wolves winger Diogo Jota back after the Portugal international returned from a calf injury that had ruled him out of the World Cup.

""Diogo is an exceptional player. He needs to get rhythm now,"" Klopp said.

""He was tired after the game on Saturday (a 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace) and we have to see. He will definitely be involved again ... He's a top class player, versatile, helpful for this busy period."""
11,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/drivers-urged-help-steer-f1-away-moral-vacuum-3312756,"LONDON: Lewis Hamilton and other Formula One drivers can help steer the sport away from a 'moral vacuum' by speaking out at season-opening races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, human rights campaigners said on Tuesday.

Paul Scriven, a member of Britain's House of Lords, told a news conference organised by the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) that the sport was at a fork in the road.

""There are two roads that F1 can now take. One is a road which is a moral vacuum where the leaders and the administrators seem to going,"" he said.

""There is another road that some drivers seem to be taking ... who understand they can use their platform and their sport not just for sport's sake but for good and for change and that they cannot ignore the human rights abuses in the country that they are driving in.""

Mercedes driver Hamilton, a seven-times world champion, has used his profile to address rights abuses and racial injustice around the world.

The sport's governing body updated the sporting code last December requiring drivers to get prior written permission to make or display ""political, religious and personal statements or comments"".

Hamilton, who said in 2021 that Formula One cannot ignore issues in the countries it visits, has vowed to continue speaking out and other drivers have said the same.

Bahrain hosts the opening race on Sunday, with the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on Mar 19.

BIRD said human rights in the two countries had been ""increasingly trampled on"" since last year's grands prix and accused Formula One of helping to ""facilitate sportswashing of abuses.""

It called for an independent enquiry to examine the role of races in human rights violations.

The accusation of 'sportswashing' is levelled at countries who are perceived to be using sport to improve a tarnished image abroad.

BIRD said it had written to Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali urging him to meet victims and use ""all available leverage"" to seek the release of jailed activists.

A statement was read out on behalf of families of 12 prisoners BIRD said were facing death sentences in Bahrain.

The Sunni-ruled state, a US ally, crushed an anti-government uprising led largely by the Shi'ite Muslim community in 2011.

Bahrain's government has said it ""actively supports the role Formula One can play in shedding light on human rights issues in all countries it operates in"".

Scriven said Formula One drivers would be justified in refusing to race in certain countries if the sport failed to put in place a proper ethical framework.

Formula One said it sought to be a positive force everywhere it raced and had made its position on human rights and other issues clear to all partners and hosts.

A spokesman for the FIA, which does not draw up the calendar, said it could not interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state but was not insensitive ""to any potential hardships endured by the people concerned""."

Fontaine, 89, netted 30 goals from 21 caps for France between 1953-1960."
14,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/upbeat-new-zealand-back-same-squad-deliver-against-sri-lanka-3314896,"New Zealand selectors have backed the same squad that held a rampaging England to a 1-1 draw to beat Sri Lanka in the two-test series starting in Christchurch next week.

They saw no need to tinker after New Zealand pulled off an incredible one-run win in the second test in Wellington on Tuesday after being asked to follow on by England captain Ben Stokes, coach Gary Stead said.

Opener Devon Conway was nursing a groin strain at the Basin Reserve and paceman Matt Henry had tightness in his back, but both were expected to be fit and available for Christchurch.

Faith in the playing group has been restored quickly, with Stead admitting after the 267-run defeat in the first test in Mount Maunganui that New Zealand were down on confidence.

""We felt that the 13 that we have here is the right 13 to go forward,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. ""I think when you have a win like that (in Wellington), whether you win or lose, your confidence will improve.""

Having won the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC) in 2021, New Zealand's title defence is already over, but the Sri Lanka series has ramifications for this year's championship.

Sri Lanka could sneak into the WTC final if they whitewash New Zealand and if Australia are swept by India in the ongoing four-test series.

India, leading the home series 2-0, need only one more victory to secure their place in the final.

New Zealand will look to regroup for the next WTC but Wellington shed much of the gloom that has engulfed the side since a slew of seasoned players retired or opted out of test cricket last year.

Kane Williamson scored a century in a welcome return to form while wicketkeeper Tom Blundell had a terrific test with the bat and behind the stumps.

New Zealand's main concerns lie in their bowling, with quality quicks thin on the ground after Trent Boult's decision to opt out of his national contract and Kyle Jamieson's continuing back problems.

The Black Caps have also been unable to unearth a high-quality all-rounder to replace Colin de Grandhomme and provide support for pacemen Tim Southee, Henry and Neil Wagner.

All-rounder Michael Bracewell laboured in that role in Wellington where his deficiencies as a part-time spinner were exposed and his batting contributed only 46 runs in four innings.

Those concerns were set aside on Wednesday as the team soaked up acclaim in the nation's media for pulling off the 'Miracle at the Basin' and protecting their unbeaten record in home test series dating back to 2017.

""I think we’ve had (character) in the team all the time I’ve been there,"" Stead said. ""And probably before that as well. When you look back over the last 10 years or so we’ve been a team that have punched above our weight and I think yesterday was a great example of that."""

Benn, 26, also criticised the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) for lacking consideration for his mental state and reiterated his innocence in a statement on social media on Tuesday.

The WBC ruled on Feb. 22 Benn's ""highly elevated consumption of eggs"" was a reasonable explanation for failed tests last year. It found no procedural failures and no conclusive evidence that Benn had intentionally ingested the banned substance Clomiphene.

Positive findings for ""trace amounts of a fertility drug"" in a random test carried out by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) led to Benn's fight with compatriot Chris Eubank Jr being called off in October.

""In my defence to the WBC and the 270-page report provided to them, at no point did I indicate that I failed any VADA tests because of contaminated eggs,"" Benn said. ""I feel like the WBC statement did a disservice to my defence.

""As part of its lengthy investigation, the WBC instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet, and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause.

""My sample appears to have come back clear the first three times it was tested. Without explanation it was retested again after nine days and only then did it show a trace positive result.""

Benn, whose father Nigel was a super-middleweight world champion, relinquished his licence with the BBBofC after his fight with Eubank Jr was called off. He remains under investigation by UKAD, Britain's anti-doping body.

The BBBofC said last Wednesday it was not part of the WBC's review.

""I have never previously failed any kind of anti-doping test, and passed multiple tests with both UKAD and VADA in close proximity to the two tests that returned adverse findings,"" Benn added.

""This adds further proof to my belief that the findings were testing errors.

""As for the BBBofC, they attacked me publicly and privately during the most difficult time in my life, treating me with utter contempt and without any consideration for fair process or my mental state.""

The WBC and BBBofC did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

Matt Kuhnemann (5-16) claimed his maiden five-wicket haul in only his second test and Lyon picked up three to skittle out India for a paltry 109.

Australia lost Travis Head, but cruised to 71-1 at tea to stay on course for a handy first-innings lead in the match.

Usman Khawaja was batting on 33 at the break with Marnus Labuschagne on 16 at the other end.

Beaten inside three days both in Nagpur and Delhi, Australia persisted with a three-pronged spin attack which paid dividends.

Stand-in skipper Steve Smith introduced spin after five overs of pace bowling by Mitchell Starc and Cameron Green, both of whom returned from finger injuries to play their first match of the series.

Regular skipper Pat Cummins is back home to be with his ailing mother, while opener David Warner has returned having fractured his elbow in Delhi.

India captain Rohit Sharma was left to rue his decision to bat first and he himself could have been dismissed twice in the first over from Starc, but Australia did not challenge the not-out decisions.

It did not really matter though once the spinners took over.

Kuhnemann removed Rohit (12) stumped and, in his next over, cut short Shubman Gill's (21) promising knock to trigger a spectacular collapse.

Lyon (3-35) then joined the party, dismissing Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja in his successive overs and India slumped to 45-5 after a frenetic opening hour.

Virat Kohli (22) gamely hung on for a while but once Todd Murphy trapped him lbw, wickets started tumbling and India eventually wilted in 33.2 overs, half an hour into the second session.

After the innings break, India predictably began with spin from both ends and Head (nine) fell lbw to Ravindra Jadeja in the second over of the innings.

Labuschagne got a reprieve when he dragged the ball onto his stumps but bowler Ravindra Jadeja was found to have over-stepped.

This was the third time in the series that Jadeja's penchant to bowl no-balls cost him a wicket.

India have a 2-0 lead in the four-match series for the Border Gavaskar Trophy.

While Stokes had no regrets about enforcing the follow-on in the one-run defeat in Wellington, he had plenty about the state of his left knee which had him grimacing in pain throughout the drawn two-test series.

Knee trouble has long bothered Stokes but he has soldiered on through 10 test wins in 12 matches since taking charge of England last year.

Things appeared to have come to a head in Wellington, though, where the all-rounder managed to bowl only two overs and was in all sorts of bother when batting despite making 60 runs.

A reliable wicket-taker who often makes things happen with the ball, Stokes' seam bowling was not needed in the first innings as New Zealand were bundled out for 209.

However, England's bowlers might have yearned for their captain's support after he enforced the follow-on and put them in the field again.

New Zealand went on to rack up 483 against them as they tired and set a chase that England fell just short of.

Rather than rest up for the three-and-a-half months before the Ashes, Stokes will be heading to the Indian Premier League (IPL) starting March 31 to fulfil his $2 million deal with the Chennai Super Kings.

Former England captain Michael Vaughan called on Stokes to forgo the IPL to boost his chances of being fully fit for the Ashes which start in Birmingham on June 16.

Stokes wasn't having it.

""I've been working hard with the physios and the medics out here to try to get myself into a place where I can fill that (bowling) role like how I have done the last 10 years or however long it is,"" he said in Wellington.

""I've got a four-month period now to get it, sort of, even better before that Ashes because I want to be turning up in Birmingham being able to fill that role properly.""

England's attacking 'Bazball' revolution under Stokes and head coach Brendon 'Baz' McCullum has breathed new life into test cricket and raised hopes of a classic Ashes contest after Australia dominated the last series 4-0 at home in 2021-22.

Stokes's ability to get through five tests, let alone bowl in them, will be under the microscope.

There are no such doubts, however, about England's commitment to its attacking game and employing it during the Ashes - despite the Wellington setback.

""You have to lose games to really appreciate how good it is to win games,"" he said.

Foster had urged NZR to wait until after the World Cup to decide, however the governing body said ""recent events"" and competition for talent in the global rugby market had forced their hand.

""Following wide ranging consultation and after carefully weighing up all scenarios and the key lessons from 2019, New Zealand Rugby is now commencing a process for selecting the All Blacks Head Coach from 2024,"" NZR Chairwoman Patsy Reddy said in a statement.

""Noting the divergent views as to the best timings for this process and that neither timing window is perfect, out of respect for the people involved, New Zealand Rugby will not be making any further comment after today until a decision has been reached.

""This will be concluded in the next four to six weeks.""

The statement comes three weeks after Scott Robertson, tipped to succeed Foster after the World Cup, said he was expecting an imminent announcement about his future in the New Zealand coaching structure.

Robertson lost out to Foster for the role when Steve Hansen stood down in 2019 but the success he has overseen at the Canterbury Crusaders has earned him plenty of coaching offers in other countries.

Reddy said Foster and the current All Blacks staff continued to have NZR's ""full support"" up to and through the World Cup.

Foster told New Zealand media last week that he might like to continue in the role if the All Blacks won the global showpiece.

On Wednesday, he said he would accept NZR's decision and move on.

""As I said last week, I felt the best thing for our team and for our entire management group was to have this process done after the Rugby World Cup,"" he said in a statement.

""My sole focus remains unchanged. It is to lead this All Blacks team and management group in our planning and preparation so that we go to France with the goal of winning the Rugby World Cup and making this country proud.

""I won't be re-applying for the job.""

Foster was under intense scrutiny last year when the All Blacks suffered three consecutive defeats against Ireland and South Africa but NZR endorsed him as coach through to the World Cup following a review in August.

He subsequently guided the All Blacks to an eighth Rugby Championship title and an undefeated tour of the northern hemisphere at the end of last season."

An average of 286,000 and 291,000 viewers tuned in Saturday and Sunday, respectively, to watch six-times major winner Phil Mickelson and former number one Dustin Johnson lead an all-star cast at LIV's season opener in Mayakoba, Mexico, according to Nielsen.

With fewer marquee names to boast in its field, the PGA Tour's Honda Classic brought in 1.61 million viewers Saturday and 2.38 million on Sunday, by comparison, on NBC.

LIV Golf did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

LIV Golf is the first sport to broadcast on the CW Network, after the two parties agreed a multi-year deal in January.

Perry Sook, the chairman and CEO of CW Network parent company Nexstar, said on Tuesday's earnings call that the three-day tournament was viewed by more than 1.4 million across the network and its digital platform.

""We're very pleased with our first weekend of LIV Golf,"" said Sook.

""It's selling very well and I think we'll continue to grow as we get more into the season and more involved.""

Bankrolled by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, LIV Golf attracted some of the sport's biggest names with the promise of supersize paydays and a truncated schedule. The PGA Tour, meanwhile, has suspended members who joined the breakaway circuit.

The 14-event season kicked off amid an ongoing rift between the two sides, as another two competitors, Chilean Mito Pereira, who finished third in last year's PGA Championship, and Colombian Sebastian Munoz joined LIV earlier this month.

Charles Howell pocketed a $4 million individual prize at the LIV event, while Chris Kirk took home $1.512 million at the Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida."

The Belgium international suffered an ankle injury after coming on as a substitute in the weekend defeat by Arsenal and missed Tuesday's FA Cup loss to Blackburn Rovers.

""Youri will be out for six weeks. Six weeks will feel like six months when you lose a player of that quality,"" Rodgers said on a bad night for the Midlands club.

""Sadly he's done the ligaments in his ankle. He won't be back before the international break.""

Leicester are only three points above the Premier League relegation zone and the loss of Tielemans comes at a crucial stage of the season for Rodgers.

""We've got a really important number of games now and the sole focus is now getting the best team we possibly can out every time we play and look to get the results,"" he said.

""If we can have that determination and fight to match some of the quality we have, we will win the games we need to. But it's going to be a fight for sure."""
32,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/player-revolts-plunge-womens-world-cup-buildup-turmoil-3313711,"MANCHESTER, England : Player protests and high-level resignations are dominating headlines amid a growing sense of reckoning in women's soccer less than five months before the World Cup kicks off.

Noel Le Graet, president of France's soccer federation (FFF), resigned on Tuesday, while Canada Soccer boss Nick Bontis stepped down a day earlier with those countries' players embroiled in bitter disputes with their federations.

Canada's women's team have vowed to boycott a pre-World Cup camp next month over equal pay and support, while Le Graet faced allegations of harassment. A government ministry audit concluded the 81-year-old Le Graet did not have the ""necessary legitimacy"" for the position.

French women's coach Corinne Diacre is also under fire and her future may be decided on March 9 by an FFF select committee.

Spain has also been rocked by a revolt by 15 players, who withdrew from selection consideration in protest at coach Jorge Vilda.

While the clashes could cast a cloud over the women's global showcase, which begins on July 20th in New Zealand and Australia, players have vowed their fights are far from over, and some say the recent resignations should be just the tip of widespread changes.

""Bontis' departure MUST trigger sweeping change,"" Amy Walsh, who played for Canada at the 2008 Olympics and earned 102 caps, posted on Twitter. ""It's not enough.

""Our athletes - as well as future generations of Canadian footballers - deserve so much better.""

Neither Bontis nor Le Graet, however, are leaving the game. Bontis was named CONCACAF Council vice-president (North America) on Saturday, while Le Graet, who has denied all accusations, has reportedly been pegged to lead FIFA's Paris office.

SUCCESS ON THE PITCH

The turmoil in the two women's programmes is in stark contrast to their success on the pitch. Canada are the reigning Olympic women's champions, while France topped their group in World Cup qualifying.

And while the governance battles rage on, female footballers have forged strong bonds - regardless of what country's colours they wear. When the Canadian women played the recent SheBelieves Cup under protest, they found they had allies in players from around the world.

Both the Americans, who settled an equal pay lawsuit with their federation for $24 million a year ago, and Japanese wore purple tape on their wrists at the SheBelieves Cup, while the U.S. women said in a statement: ""Although we are now on the other side of this fight... our counterparts in Canada and elsewhere are experiencing the same pervasive misogyny and unequal treatment that we faced.""

Across the pond, England's Lionesses wore purple wristbands at the Arnold Clark Cup, to ""display their support (for) the Canadian WNT players and for gender equality,"" the team said in a tweet.

Canada's call for equality goes beyond equal pay. Forward Janine Beckie, who was in Qatar for last year's men's World Cup as part of Canada's broadcast crew, saw the ""disgusting"" discrepancy between the two programmes.

She cited as an example that the Canadian men's team staff was twice the size of the women's.

""I think we've been fighting blindly not knowing what our federation was capable of in terms of support, and then we were all witnesses to what our men's team received,"" said longtime captain Christine Sinclair.

Canadian midfielder Sophie Schmidt told media through tears in Orlando that she nearly quit over shoddy treatment from their federation, but Sinclair and coach Bev Priestman convinced her to reconsider.

France's team captain Wendie Renard said last week she would not play at the World Cup as long as Diacre is in charge.

Fellow French internationals Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Kadidiatou Diani have also said they were taking a step back from the national team.

Spain's 15 players declared themselves unavailable, saying in a statement that playing ""significantly"" affected their ""emotional state.""

The federation replied saying that it wouldn't tolerate any pressure from players.

Lyon took the lead in the 24th minute through a close-range header by Barcola, who was nicely set up by Nicolas Tagliafico.

Jeffinho doubled their lead with a brilliant individual effort shortly before halftime, scoring his first goal for Lyon since he joined in January from Brazilian side Botafogo.

Grenoble pulled one back in the 74th minute, after a mistake by the Lyon defence allowed winger Amine Sbai to make it 2-1.

Five-time winners Lyon, who knocked out Lille on penalties in the last 16, are looking to lift the French Cup for the first time since 2012.

Nantes host Lens on Wednesday, before Toulouse face Rodez and Olympique de Marseille take on Annecy to decide the other semi-finalists."
