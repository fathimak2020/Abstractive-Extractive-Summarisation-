Djokovic suffered a 3cm hamstring tear en route to winning the Adelaide warm-up event before claiming his 22nd Grand Slam title at Melbourne Park to go level with Rafa Nadal.

The 35-year-old Serb said his Dubai participation was in doubt until a few days ago but he had passed all his fitness tests.

""Had a couple of weeks of no tennis. The last few days it's really getting as much practice as possible to get myself back in shape to be able to compete at a high level,"" Djokovic said.

""I haven't felt pain on the court for a week. I'm getting closer to 100 per cent. Still not there in terms of the game and how I feel on court. But the important thing is there's no pain. I don't have a hindrance in the way I move on the court.

""After every injury it takes time for mechanisms to be balanced, for adjustments to be done on court. It takes time to find that groove of moving effortlessly and not thinking about if something's going to happen. I don't have those thoughts.""

Djokovic begins the Dubai tournament having entered his 378th week as world number one, surpassing Steffi Graf as the player with the most weeks at the top of the sport.

""It's surreal to be that many weeks number one, to match Graf - one of the all-time greats,"" Djokovic said. ""Just being amongst these legendary names is flattering. I'm proud of it.""

Djokovic meets Czech Tomas Machac in the first round on Tuesday (Feb 28)."
2,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/future-looking-bright-manchester-united-ten-hag-delivers-silverware-3307216,"LONDON: Manchester United's near six-year trophy drought was almost overlooked in the build-up to the League Cup final as Newcastle United's wait for major silverware spanned nearly seven decades.

A clinical 2-0 victory at Wembley got the Old Trafford trophy cabinet door swinging open again though and, perhaps more importantly, gave a glimpse of greater things to come under astute Dutch manager Erik ten Hag.

The former Ajax Amsterdam boss arrived at Old Trafford with the club in a state of some turmoil on and off the pitch after finishing in sixth place in the Premier League last season.

But while there is little he can do about the future ownership of the 20-time English champions, which the American Glazer family have expressed a wish to sell, on the pitch he is shaping a team that looks capable of reviving the glory days.

A season that began under a Cristiano Ronaldo-shaped cloud has been transformed since the Portuguese talisman was finally shown the door after a toxic fall-out.

Ten Hag has quietly gone about his business, moulding an intelligent team that works tirelessly and is beginning to make winning a habit. A sixth League Cup triumph ended the club's longest wait for a trophy since 1983.

And the season could still get better. They are in the fifth round of the FA Cup, the last 16 of the Europa League after knocking out Barcelona in midweek and in third place in the Premier League and not out of the title race.

Ten Hag experienced some difficult early days. A 4-0 hammering at Brentford in August had some predicting he might be out before the leaves fell off the trees and then there was a humiliating 6-3 defeat at Manchester City.

Since that drubbing at The Etihad in early October, United have lost only twice in all competitions, forward Marcus Rashford has turned into a world-beater and the signing of midfielder Casemiro has looked like a stroke of genius.

A defence built around the terrier-like Lisandro Martinez and the cultured Raphael Varane snuffed out Newcastle on Sunday, winger Antony is becoming a fan favourite and even old-fashioned centre forward Wout Weghorst, a puzzling signing at the time, looks as though he would run through brick walls for Ten Hag."
4,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/clinical-manchester-united-win-league-cup-heartbreak-newcastle-3307061,"LONDON: Manchester United crushed Newcastle United's hopes of a claiming a first domestic trophy for nearly 70 years with a clinical 2-0 victory in the League Cup final at Wembley on Sunday (Feb 26).

A header by Casemiro followed by an own goal by Sven Botman late in the first half silenced the hordes of Newcastle fans who flocked to the capital full of optimism as Manchester United went on to lift the trophy for a sixth time with relative ease.

Much of the build-up was about Newcastle's first appearance in a major final since 1999 and an uptick in their fortunes instigated by Eddie Howe since a 2021 Saudi Arabia-led takeover.

But Erik ten Hag's resurgent United side showed them how far they still need to go as they claimed the club's first trophy since winning the Europa League under Jose Mourinho in 2017 - their longest wait for silverware since 1983.

""It has been an amazing period, first trophy of the season but we want more it is not enough for this club, we want more and we need more because our standards demand more,"" Bruno Fernandes, who was denied a third goal in stoppage time, said.

""For me it was about winning trophies and finally we did it. I am satisfied but I want more. I want much more.""

There was little between the sides in a scrappy first half but the English season's first silverware was effectively decided in the space of six minutes towards halftime.

Newcastle were stunned when Brazilian Casemiro met a superb Luke Shaw free kick in the 33rd minute to head past Loris Karius, the goal allowed to stand after a VAR check for offside.

Six minutes later Newcastle were left totally deflated when the in-form Marcus Rashford was played in down the left and his shot deflected over a helpless Karius for what initially appeared to be his 17th goal since the World Cup.

However, it was credited to the unfortunate Botman.

Kicking towards their fans in the second half Newcastle roused themselves into action and pinned a leggy-looking United back at times but they rarely looked like scoring.

Newcastle's fans, who had created a sea of black and white with give-away plastic flags at the stadium's west side during the closing minutes, drifted away before the presentation.

The Tyneside club has now lost each of their last nine matches at Wembley, a run that began in the 1974 FA Cup final.

Instead the stage was left for United whose fans were in full voice as Bruno Fernandes raised the trophy which they hope will be the first of many under Dutchman Ten Hag whose first season goes from strength to strength after some difficult early days."

Former Germany coach Klinsmann replaced Paulo Bento, who stepped down following South Korea's defeat by Brazil in the World Cup last 16 in December.

The Korea Football Association (KFA) said Klinsmann had signed a contract until the 2026 World Cup, which will be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

""I know that the Korean national team has been improving and achieving results over a long period of time,"" Klinsmann said in a statement.

""I am honoured to follow in the footsteps of the great coaches who have led the Korean national team, from Gus Hiddink to my predecessor, Paulo Bento.

""I look forward to doing my utmost to help the team achieve success at the upcoming Asian Cup and the 2026 World Cup.""

After retiring as a player in 1998, Klinsmann was Germany's head coach from 2004-06 and led them to a third-place finish at the 2006 World Cup on home soil.

He managed his former club Bayern Munich in the 2008-09 season before becoming head coach of the US national team from 2011 to 2016.

The 58-year-old led the US to the CONCACAF Gold Cup title in 2013 and was named the CONCACAF Coach of the Year.

Klinsmann's first match in charge of South Korea will be a home friendly against Colombia on Mar 24.

The KFA said Klinsmann's coaching team had not been finalised, adding that the German would live in South Korea for the duration of his tenure."

Seconds after the break, Skipp picked up a clearance by Chelsea's British record signing Enzo Fernandez and fired in from more than 20 yards, his shot going in off the bar after Kepa Arrizabalaga could not get enough of a hand on it.

Kane secured the three points for Spurs when he pounced at the far post after a corner by Son Heung-min was flicked on by Eric Dier in the 82nd minute.

Chelsea, who failed to score for fourth time in five league games despite spending around 300 million pounds ($358 million)on players in January alone, failed to create any clear-cut chances to get themselves back into the game.

The win - the first for the hosts in nine league games against Chelsea - kept Spurs fourth in the table, four points ahead of fifth-placed Newcastle United who have played two games less.

Chelsea sit in 10th position, 14 points behind Spurs. Potter's side have now won only two games in their last 15 in all competitions."
8,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/psg-romp-3-0-win-over-marseille-thanks-mbappe-messi-double-act-3307281,"PARIS: World Cup foes Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe inspired Paris St Germain to a 3-0 win at bitter rivals Olympique de Marseille on Sunday to extend their Ligue 1 lead to eight points.

Mbappe, who bagged a double, was set up by Messi for both his goals, and repaid the favour by laying on another for the Argentine forward as PSG, who were without the injured Neymar, moved to 60 points from 25 games with second-placed Marseille on 52.

France forward Mbappe, who was on the losing side against Messi's Argentina in the World Cup final, became PSG's joint record scorer with 200 goals - level with Edinson Cavani - while Messi netted his 700th in club football.

""We were aggressive, we put intensity into the game, that's what we'd been missing,"" said PSG centre back Sergio Ramos.

Marseille coach Igor Tudor said he did not regret his side's high-risk approach.

""Why should we have changed our way of playing? It has been working well this season,"" he said.

""Mbappe's presence didn't change anything. His presence made it more difficult for us to play our game but we were not going to change it.""

Third-placed Monaco slumped to a 3-0 home defeat against Nice, who prevailed thanks to a Terem Moffi double and a superb half-volley by Khephren Thuram.

The result left Monaco on 50 points, ahead of fourth-placed RC Lens on goals scored after the northerners drew 1-1 at Montpellier on Saturday.

PSG, who were knocked out of the French Cup in the last 16 by Marseille earlier this month, ended a three-game losing streak in all competitions by beating Lille last weekend and they were focused throughout at the Velodrome.

They suffered an early injury blow when Presnel Kimpembe, who missed the World Cup for France with an Achilles issue, left the pitch on a stretcher, two weeks after making his comeback from a three-month layoff.

Matteo Guendouzi created danger as Marseille pressed high and hard but they were exposed on the counter and the hosts were punished in the 25th minute when Messi played Mbappe through for the France forward to race into the area and beat Pau Lopez with a low shot.

The roles were reversed four minutes later as Mbappe delivered a pin-point cross for Messi, who tapped in from point-blank range to double the advantage in front of an all-time Ligue 1 record attendance of 65,800.

Messi then missed a sitter and Mbappe was denied by Lopez after being found in the area by the Argentine again, just before Marquinhos's angled shot went just wide as Marseille were again caught on the break.

Messi beautifully lifted the ball into the path of Mbappe, who volleyed home with his left foot for his 16th goal of the season in Ligue 1.

Gianluigi Donnarumma made a spectacular save from Nuno Tavares's header in the 67th to snuff out any hope of a Marseille comeback as PSG secured a first clean sheet in six league games.

PSG next face Nantes at home before travelling to Bayern Munich for their Champions League last-16 return leg after losing the first encounter 1-0 at the Parc des Princes."

Barca are top of the league standings on 59 points, seven ahead second-placed Real Madrid who were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Atletico Madrid on Saturday. Almeria are 15th on 25 points, two clear of the relegation zone.

Almeria halted Barca's seven game winning streak in the league and delivered another blow to the Catalans who, after going unbeaten in 18 matches in all competitions, have now lost two straight matches after being knocked out of the Europa League on Thursday.

The hosts were the better side in the first half and scored after 24 minutes when Luis Suarez sent a perfect long pass to Toure who was ghosting behind Barca's defence. The Malian striker ran towards the area and hit a thunderous strike in off the crossbar.

It was only the eighth goal Barcelona have conceded in La Liga this season, the least of any team in the top five leagues in Europe.

Almeria should have extended their lead but Leo Baptistao's strike was blocked by goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Rodrigo Ely then missed a sitter from close-range, sending wide a header from a corner when he was all alone in the area.

""I'm very angry because I think we made the worst game of the season by far, mainly in the first half,"" Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez told Movistar Plus.

""We were not good and wasted a great opportunity in a match we could not afford to lose after what happened to Real Madrid.

""It was a golden opportunity today and it ended with a really bad day for us. No excuses, it was the worst showing of our side in the entire season.""

Xavi made five substitutions after the break, but Barca could not beat a disciplined Almeria defence.

Almeria, who had won only one of their last eight matches, held on to secure the three precious points as they bid to avoid relegation."
10,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/inter-title-hopes-fade-more-misery-bologna-3306706,"BOLOGNA, Italy: Inter Milan suffered a damaging 1-0 defeat at Bologna on Sunday (Feb 26) which virtually ended their slim hopes of winning the Serie A title.

At the same ground where their title aspirations were dealt a fatal blow last season, Riccardo Orsolini's goal condemned Inter to another loss.

Simone Inzaghi's team are second in the standings on 47 points from 24 matches, 18 behind leaders Napoli who beat Empoli 2-0 on Saturday.

Inter will also be looking over their shoulders with concern at AC Milan and AS Roma, who are level on 44 points and are yet to play in this round of fixtures. Bologna are seventh on 35 points.

Bologna thought they had taken the lead at a rain-sodden Stadio Renato Dall'Ara through Musa Barrow in the 12th minute, only for the effort to be ruled out following a VAR review.

Minutes later, Roberto Soriano rattled the woodwork on the rebound after Andre Onana had parried Andrea Cambiaso's volley into his path.

Inzaghi, missing Federico Dimarco, Milan Skriniar and Joaquin Correa through injury, rested Nicolo Barella among a raft of changes from their midweek Champions League win over Porto, and his much-changed Inter team lacked fluidity.

They had brief spells of possession in the first half, but created few clear-cut chances as Lautaro Martinez headed an Alessandro Bastoni cross just wide of the target and Henrikh Mkhitaryan twice fired over the bar.

Bologna continued to press forward after the break, and Andre Onana kept his side in the game with two crucial saves in quick succession, getting a hand to a Soriano shot before smothering Dominguez's effort from the edge of the area.

Romelu Lukaku and substitute Edin Dzeko each had a shot on target, but it was Bologna who broke the deadlock in the 76th minute when Orsolini raced on to Jerdy Schouten's pass and powered a shot into the net.

""An incredible match in which many things happened. They cancelled a goal for us, we put Inter down by playing really well and we are satisfied,"" Orsolini told DAZN.

""Schouten put a ball to me, I took advantage of the bounce to bring the ball forward with my chest and in front of Onana I tried to place it under the crossbar.""

In April last year, Bologna recorded a 2-1 home win over Inter, which gave the Nerazzurri's rivals AC Milan the momentum in the title race."

Odion Ighalo scored four and Moussa Marega netted twice while Salem Al Dawsari was also on target for the four-time winners from Saudi Arabia, who will now take on Urawa over two legs on April 29 and May 6.

The pair last met in 2019 when Al Hilal avenged a loss to the J.League side in the 2017 final and Maciej Skorza's side will face a major challenge to deny Al Hilal a record fifth title.

Ighalo put Al Hilal in front with barely 90 seconds on the clock when Mohammed Kanno's persistence set up the former Manchester United striker with the simplest of headed finishes, and the onslaught soon gathered unstoppable momentum.

The Nigerian added a second in the 10th minute having seen Al Duhail goalkeeper Salah Zakaria deny him five minutes earlier.

But when Brazilian winger Michael Oliveira centred, after being released down the right by defender Jang Hyun-soo, Ighalo made no mistake.

Four minutes later Marega slotted in following Al Dawsari's centre from the left and the Mali international made it 4-0 in the 28th minute when he latched onto goalkeeper Abdullah Al Mauoif's long punt down the middle.

Al Dawsari hit his side's fifth seven minutes before the interval when he swept in Marega's clever backheel and the former Porto forward thought he had claimed a sixth for his side, only for his volley to be ruled out by VAR for offside.

Ighalo ensured there was to be no respite for Al Duhail at the start of the second half when he clipped the ball over Zakaria to complete his hat-trick three minutes after the interval.

He then hit his fourth in the 62nd minute, converting from Abdullah Al Hamdan's cut-back to put the seal on the most comprehensive win and keep Al Hilal on track to become the first team to claim back-to-back titles since Al Ittihad in 2005."

Six minutes after Casemiro had opened the scoring, Rashford was through on goal again and his shot took a deflection off Sven Botman before looping over the goalkeeper, going down as an own goal.

""Manchester United's second goal in the Carabao Cup Final officially went to Marcus Rashford! It means he finishes the competition as top scorer with six goals, having scored in every round,"" organisers said in a statement.

Rashford has now scored 25 goals for United this season, 17 of which have come after the World Cup break, but this was special as it delivered the Old Trafford club their first trophy since 2017 when they won the Europa League.

Bristol City, who are managed by Nigel Pearson, have been unbeaten in all competitions since the last week of December, moving up to 13th in the second-tier Championship.

The last time the two teams faced each other at Ashton Gate, Manchester City edged Bristol City 3-2 in the League Cup semi-finals second leg in 2018 en route to Guardiola's first trophy with the English club.

""From my experience in this country, in the last six years, when you go (play) away in the FA cup at a Championship team, it is always, always tough. (Playing at) home is a little different,"" Guardiola told reporters ahead of Tuesday's clash.

""Last 12 games - no defeat. That means they are there. My scouts are saying it's a good team. The manager has experience, did really well with Leicester (City) and Watford when he was there one or two seasons ago.

""It's a final. The FA cup is a really, really important competition, so it's a serious team we will play tomorrow.""

Manchester City bounced back from two consecutive draws to beat Bournemouth 4-1 over the weekend but Guardiola feels the team can play better as they sit two points behind league leaders Arsenal, who have a game in hand.

""The way we are playing is good, results could be better. Sometimes it happens in football,"" Guardiola said.

""I have no complaints about how we are playing and how we are fighting. The mood in the locker room is exceptional and the guys are doing everything - that is enough for me.

""I have the feeling in the Premier League many things are going to happen, everyone is going to drop points. But we cannot drop any, we want to fight until the end.""

Guardiola confirmed influential midfielder Kevin De Bruyne is still suffering from ""a little bit of illness"" after sitting out the trip to Bournemouth while he will also take a late call on defenders John Stones and Aymeric Laporte."

The Caribbean side are coming off a 1-0 series win in Zimbabwe earlier this month, but before that were thumped in Australia late last year and will face similar seamer-friendly conditions on their short tour of South Africa.

""It won’t be easy, South Africa are a tough team at home, but we are looking forward to playing some hard days of test cricket,"" Brathwaite told reporters on Monday.

""It is important we take control of every hour, and not look at the big picture, just go from session to session.""

West Indies have lost 12 of their previous 15 tests in South Africa and won just one, though this is the first time they have toured the country in the longest format since 2015. Their only victory was a surprise success in Gqeberha 16 years ago.

Brathwaite, who opens the batting, concedes it will be a big step up from what they faced in Zimbabwe and it will be up to the batters to lay the platform for success against the home side's vaunted pace attack on helpful wickets.

""Zimbabwe isn’t a top team in the world so we are really looking to challenging ourselves here. We need to improve as batters and it is important as openers to set the foundation or the team,"" he said.

""It looks a good wicket, stats say batters can get runs on this pitch and the spinners will turn it later in the game.

Can Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton add to his record tally of 103 victories?

There are plenty of storylines to the season that starts in Bahrain on March 5. The following looks at some of them.

TRIPLE MAX

Verstappen will start as favourite for a third title in a row. The Dutch driver won 15 races last year. How many can he bag this time? And can team mate Sergio Perez get closer to him?

NEW BOSSES

Four of the 10 teams have new principals since 2022.

Fred Vasseur has replaced Mattia Binotto at Ferrari, joining from Sauber/Alfa Romeo in January.

McLaren's Andreas Seidl has joined Sauber, appointing Alessandro Alunni Bravo to what is effectively a principal role, with Andrea Stella stepping up at McLaren while James Vowles moved from a strategy role at Mercedes to boss of Williams.

FERRARI

Can Vasseur bring a title to Maranello for the first time since the 2008 constructors' championship?

The Frenchman's arrival has drawn comparisons with compatriot Jean Todt, who led the team through a golden era with Michael Schumacher in the early 2000s.

NEW FACES

There are three rookies on the grid.

Australian Oscar Piastri joined McLaren in controversial circumstances after a contract dispute with Alpine while Nyck de Vries has replaced Pierre Gasly (now with Alpine) at Red Bull-owned AlphaTauri.

Logan Sargeant will meanwhile be making his debut at Williams as the first grand prix racer from the United States since Alexander Rossi in 2015.

OLD FACES

Nico Hulkenberg starts his comeback at Haas, his first full season drive since 2019, with the German still chasing a first podium finish after 179 starts.

Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, now 41, and Hamilton, 38, are the oldest drivers. Can either become the first driver to win a race after reaching the milestone of 300 starts? Alonso has made 355, Hamilton 310.

LAS VEGAS

Las Vegas promises to be the big and brash event of the year with a Saturday night race on the Strip in November as the penultimate round of the season and the hype in over-drive.

Formula One's popularity in America is already surging thanks to Netflix series 'Drive to Survive'.

NEW TEAMS

Andretti Cadillac are seeking to become the 11th team on the grid from 2026. Will the sport let them in?

MERCEDES

Mercedes, champions eight years in a row, had a tough 2022 with a 'porpoising' car that proved hard to handle. Can they close the gap to Red Bull and Ferrari?

NEW DEAL

Hamilton is out of contract at the end of the year and talks on a new one have started. He will be asked about it regularly.

SPEAKING OUT

The governing FIA has tweaked the rules on drivers making political, personal and religious statements. How will they and the stewards react?

DANIEL RICCIARDO

Is he gone for good from the grid or will he be back in 2024 after signing on as Red Bull reserve? This one could run and run."

22,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/french-football-bracing-itself-black-tuesday-3309396,"PARIS : French football is bracing itself for a major shakedown as both the president of the federation (FFF) and the women's head coach are expected to resign from their positions on Tuesday.

Noel Le Graet, who has been head of the FFF since 2011, has already taken a step back amid a legal investigation into alleged sexual and moral harassment and a damning audit commissioned by the Sports ministry, will be at the centre of Tuesday's executive committee.

Should he refuse to step down, Le Graet, 81, could be brought before the FFF's disciplinary committee or the executive committee could resign to force new elections.

""Given the failures in governance, his seriously inappropriate behaviour towards women, I can only agree with the conclusion of the report: he no longer has the legitimacy to administer and represent French soccer,"" Sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera said earlier this month.

Le Graet, who also came under fire when he made dismissive comments about France great Zinedine Zidane after extending men's coach Didier Deschamps's contract until 2026, could be followed into the abyss by the women's coach, Corinne Diacre.

Diacre's position has become untenable since team captain Wendie Renard said last week that she would not play at this year's Women's World Cup to preserve her mental health.

Fellow internationals Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Kadidiatou Diani following suit soon after her announcement, all saying they were taking a step back from the national team.

Renard, who is widely considered one of the best defenders in women's football, played for France in international games against Norway, Denmark and Uruguay earlier this month.

According to a report in French multimedia outlet RMC Sport, Renard will not play for the national team as long as Diacre is in charge.

The 48-year-old Diacre, who in 2014 became the first French woman to coach a men's team when she took charge of then Ligue 2 side Clermont, was appointed France head coach in 2017.

Renard was stripped of the captaincy by Diacre following their quarter-final exit at Euro 2017, before regaining it in 2021.

Diacre had previously attracted criticism from other French players, including Gaetane Thiney and Sarah Bouhaddi.

The coach was also criticised at the European Championship in England last year for leaving out influential senior players Amandine Henry and Eugenie Le Sommer, their all-time leading goalscorer (86 goals), in her squad of 23.

France were eliminated in the semi-finals by Germany.

""I can no longer support the current system, which is far from the requirements of the highest level,"" said Renard.

The Women's World Cup takes place in Australia and New Zealand from July 20 to Aug. 20."

South Africa lost four tests in a row prior to a rain-affected draw in Australia earlier this year, though they were on their way to defeat in that match too.

The batting remains the major concern with the side having not scored more than 255 in any of their last 10 innings, which has led to recalls for Aiden Markram and Ryan Rickelton, and a potential first cap for Tony de Zorzi.

""It's the start of a new journey and we start with a clean slate. We want to go out there and play the way we want to play. It’s going to be exciting to see how that looks on the field,"" Bavuma told reporters on Monday.

""The batting unit (struggled) in the last two series in England and Australia, but those are tough tours, generally ones that separate the good guys from the really good guys.

""The guys who are still here want to man up as the batting unit, we need to score runs to give the bowlers the room to do what they need to do.""

South Africa will likely play an extra batsman at number seven with Heinrich Klaasen to keep wicket, and go in with an all pace attack on the bouncy Highveld wicket in Pretoria.

""That will still be decided by the coach (Shukri Conrad). We have resources whether we decide to go with a pace (bowling) attack, or with a spin attack. We can back up whatever tactic we go with.""

Bavuma made his test debut against the West Indies in 2014 and admits they are a special opponent for him.

""West Indies was the team I supported growing up. So there is that sentiment when it comes to them. I made 10 runs on my debut so that was nothing to write home about, hopefully this (first game as captain) goes better.

""They play old fashioned cricket. Batters grind it out, bowlers are looking to hit their areas outside off stump. They have guys who can stand up to the challenge.

""Their bowling attack has guys who can get the ball through (quickly), which is something you need in South Africa."""
26,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/murray-pulls-out-dubai-due-recurring-hip-injury-3308931,"Andy Murray has withdrawn from the Dubai Tennis Championships this week due to a recurring hip issue, tournament organisers said on Monday.

The 35-year-old, a three-times Grand Slam champion, is no stranger to hip problems and was on the verge of retirement in 2019 after having surgery the previous year.

However, he got his career back on track after another operation and stormed into his fourth ATP final since returning to the tour at last week's Qatar Open where he was beaten by Daniil Medvedev.

""We regret to inform you that Andy Murray is unable to participate in this year's tournament,"" Dubai organisers said in a post on Twitter. ""Andy has been dealing with a recurring hip injury that has unfortunately forced him out of Dubai.""

Murray said after his defeat by Medvedev that he would have to manage his body better, especially after physically demanding matches.

""At my age and with some of the issues that I've got, I do have to be mindful of those things. I cannot just keep going until something happens,"" Murray said.

""I need to be a bit smarter with that.""

Murray's pullout from Dubai comes a day after fellow Briton Emma Raducanu, the 2021 U.S. Open champion, withdrew from the Austin Open in Texas due to tonsillitis."
28,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/williamson-surpasses-taylor-new-zealands-most-prolific-test-batter-3308831,"Kane Williamson cemented his claim as New Zealand's greatest test batsman after he eclipsed Ross Taylor as the nation's leading run-scorer on the way to an inspirational century against England in the second test on Monday.

The former captain hit paceman James Anderson through midwicket for four with the fourth ball of the morning at Wellington's Basin Reserve on day four to pass Taylor's mark of 7,683 runs.

By tea, Williamson had chalked up his 26th century in tests to give the hosts some hope of pulling off an unlikely win after they were asked to follow on.

As always, the mild-mannered 32-year-old from Tauranga kept the emotions in check, barely acknowledging the warm applause from the crowd after taking the runs record.

Later in the day, after being caught behind for 132 off Harry Brook's part-time medium pace, Williamson showed he has lost none of his discomfort talking about his achievements.

""It's not something that I've sort of thought about a whole lot but it is an honour,"" he told reporters of the record.

""I look at that list and I've admired all of those players over the years, whether that's watching from afar growing up or playing alongside a number of them as well.

""It's not a focus point, but it's special to be amongst that company.""

A nation of 5 million, New Zealand has produced a slew of brilliant cricketers over the decades but none have made their mark with the bat quite like Williamson.

Taylor's tally of runs came from 112 matches, while Williamson, now on 7,787 runs at an average of 53.33, is playing his 92nd test.

Former team mate Taylor, who retired last year, was quick to congratulate him.

""This achievement is a testament to your hard work and dedication to test cricket, of which I was privy to for a number of years,"" he said.

""Here’s to many more.""

Williamson managed only 10 runs across his three previous innings of the series against England but answered the team's call for a big score on Monday.

He batted superbly through a 282-ball knock, anchoring partnerships with Henry Nicholls (29), Daryl Mitchell (54) and Tom Blundell (90) in New Zealand's second innings of 483.

Tim Southee's side will bid to record just the fourth win in history by a team asked to follow on.

Should they pull it off, they will have their quiet talisman Williamson to thank for setting up the chance.

""I think we can ask a number of questions coming in to day five,"" he said.

""It's always exciting when all three results are on the table."""
30,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/isle-man-bowled-out-10-runs-lowest-t20-score-3308641,"The Isle of Man were bowled out by Spain for 10 runs in an international match on Sunday, limping to the lowest total in men's Twenty20 cricket.

Six players in the Isle of Man's line-up were dismissed for a duck, while Joseph Burrows was their highest scorer with four runs. The team were routed in 8.4 overs.

Spain chased the total in two balls, wrapping up a 10-wicket victory in a bizarre contest.

""Crazy, just crazy,"" Spain head coach Corey Rutgers told the Cricbuzz website. ""It (the score) just went 4-4, 6-6. I've never seen anything like it in my life.""

The match was the last of the six-match series, which Spain won 5-0 after the second game was abandoned due to rain.

The Isle of Man replaced Sydney Thunder at the top of the list of the lowest innings totals in men's T20s. The Thunder were bowled out by Adelaide Strikers for 15 in the Big Bash League in December."
32,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/australias-starc-still-feels-discomfort-finger-eyes-return-third-test-3308601,"BENGALURU :Australia pace man Mitchell Starc said he still feels some discomfort in his finger after snapping a tendon in a fielding mishap in December but he expects to return to the side for the third test against India beginning on Wednesday at Indore.

The left-armer suffered the injury to the middle finger of his bowling hand and was sidelined as Australia lost the opening two tests of the four-match series against India.

With skipper Pat Cummins and batter David Warner ruled out of the contest, the tourists are likely to welcome back Starc and all-rounder Cameron Green.

""There's going to be a level of discomfort for a while, I don't think it is going to be 100 per cent for a fair while,"" Starc said on Monday. ""But it's certainly good enough. The ball's coming out quite nicely and I feel I'm pretty much at full tilt.

""It wouldn't be the first test match I've played in some sort of discomfort. If I only played when I was at 100 per cent I would have only played five or 10 tests.

""I'm happy with where it's at and I've got enough of a pain threshold to deal with that stuff over the last 10 or 12 years.""

Cummins has returned home to be with his ailing mother, leaving Steve Smith, who captained Australia between 2015 and 2018, to lead the side in his absence.

Starc felt the quicks still had a big role to play in the series, which has so far favoured the spinners.

""It's been a challenge in the last couple of weeks, the first two tests,"" he said.

""We do see spin playing a huge part in this test series but the quicks have still played a particular role, whether it be with the new ball, if it does reverse-swing, and being able to bowl that skiddy ball and bring the stumps into play.

""So there's certainly an important role to play for the seam bowlers.""

'NOT UNPLAYABLE'

Indian wicketkeeper Srikar Bharat said the turning wickets that have so far proven to be big challenges for Australia were not totally unplayable.

Bharat scored an unbeaten 23 off 22 deliveries to take India home in the second test in New Delhi and said his mindset was to keep things simple.

""The wickets aren't unplayable,"" said Bharat. ""If you apply yourself and back your defence, there's scope for a batsman to score runs.

""At this level everyone intends to score, so shot selection is important on these turners. As a batsman if you're clear with your shots, there are runs on these tracks."""
