On a freezing night in north London the Italians comfortably protected the slender advantage they established in the first leg of their last-16 tie at the San Siro as Tottenham huffed and puffed to little effect and exited with a whimper.

Tottenham failed to muster an attempt on target in the first half as their frustration boiled over with manager Antonio Conte booked for letting his emotions get the better of him while they had defender Cristian Romero sent off late on.

Milan could have made it a more comfortable night had they taken any of the good chances they created but in the end a masterclass of game management saw them through.

While Stefano Pioli's Milan can look forward with optimism, Tottenham's season is fizzling out after a dismal week in which they also lost in the FA Cup to second-tier Sheffield United and to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League.

Milan may be some way off returning to their European pomp but while they lack the household names of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Pioli's team had too much craft for a meek Tottenham side who were booed at the final whistle.

""We knew it would be tough, but we managed. I asked the players to show character. We never gave up, and we deserved to progress,"" Pioli said. ""We made it to the quarters, now let's see what happens in the draw.""

THIRD GEAR

The match kicked off 10 minutes late because of traffic issues and in truth Tottenham never got out of third gear.

Considering it was flagged as their biggest game of the season there was a mystifying lack of urgency from the hosts in the first half in which they offered the home faithful nothing to warm their spirits.

Tottenham's three-man attack of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski were forced to feed on scraps and while Milan were hardly any more potent they did have the first decent chance when Junior Messias drilled a shot wide.

The Italians came close to taking the lead just after the interval when the ball broke for first-leg scorer Brahim Diaz but his shot was blocked by the legs of Fraser Forster.

With the clock showing 64 minutes Tottenham finally warmed the gloves of Milan keeper Mike Maignan as Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, suspended for the first leg, fired in an angled drive that was parried over for a corner.

As Tottenham committed men forward gaps appeared at the back and Rafael Leao had an effort blocked and then sent another attempt over the crossbar.

Kane sent a stooping header wide as the game began to open up and Tottenham rolled the dice by sending on forward Richarlison in place of wing back Emerson.

Conte was then jeered for hauling off Kulusevski for defender Davinson Sanchez as time ran out.

Kane went close to levelling in stoppage time with a skidding header superbly saved by Maignan but Milan almost crowned their night on the counter-attack with substitute Divock Origi hitting the post in front of their already-celebrating fans.",[],

The 33-year-old Choupo-Moting, who played for PSG from 2018-20, tapped in from Leon Goretzka's assist in the 61st minute and substitute Gnabry struck in the 89th minute to seal the hosts' 3-0 aggregate win after a 1-0 victory in Paris.

The Germans made sure of their last-eight spot after shutting out PSG superstars Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe and are one of the title favourites going into the last eight.

""In the first half, we didn't do what we had talked about t before very well,"" Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann said. ""There was too much space.

""But we defended better in the second half and were dangerous on the ball. In the end, we deserved to win.""

""If we show maximum hunger with emotion and we couple that with our quality then we can achieve anything.""

PSG's long wait to win Europe's premier club trophy for the first time goes on.

Without injured forward Neymar, the French team were sharper in the early stages and went close through Mbappe and a double effort from Messi in the 25th minute.

Bayern gradually took control, however, and had a chance when Jamal Musiala's 32nd-minute shot was blocked by keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.

Despite PSG captain Marquinhos being taken off with a rib injury in the 36th minute, the visitors almost went ahead when under-pressure Bayern keeper Yann Sommer lost possession in the box.

Vitinha's shot with the goal at his mercy was cleared on the line by Matthijs de Ligt in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the game.

The Dutch defender had made an almost identical stop against VfB Stuttgart in the league last week.

With Mbappe largely quiet, it was in-form Choupo-Moting who struck just past the hour for his 17th goal in all competitions this season.

PSG attempted to bounce back instantly and Sergio Ramos's header was saved by Sommer before the Spaniard headed wide but their hopes were shattered when Gnabry rounded off a quick break with the second Bayern goal.

""We did not manage to score when we were on top of things,"" PSG coach Christophe Galtier said.

""Then we concede a ridiculous goal. What made the difference is the fact we missed some key players in both legs. It's a big disappointment but we have to swallow it.""

United, who top the standings on 35 points from 14 games, travel to Chelsea with a one-point lead, but the Blues have a game in hand and a victory for either side could give them a huge advantage as the title race hots up.

Norway international Reiten fired home a penalty low to the keeper's right to give Chelsea the lead in the 12th minute after Sam Kerr was fouled in the box, and Jess Carter doubled the home side's advantage nine minutes later.

Kerr fluffed her lines in the 67th minute, missing a great chance after Reiten threaded a beautiful ball through to her, but she made amends by setting up Rytting Kaneryd for a tap-in five minutes later, the Swede's first goal for the Blues.

Outclassed in the first half, Brighton battled back in the second and though substitute Danielle Carter scored late on, the defeat leaves them second from bottom in the table on eight points, two ahead of Leicester City.

In the evening's other game fourth-placed Arsenal, who beat Chelsea in the Women's League Cup final on Sunday, cruised to a 2-0 win over Liverpool, with Stina Blackstenius and Caitlin Foord netting the goals.",[],

Milan claimed a 1-0 aggregate victory after a goalless draw on a freezing night in London as the hosts crashed out with a whimper.

""I like to think there’s nothing impossible in sport,"" Pioli said.

""Clearly, only the best in Europe remain, and each round gets more difficult, but I am sure that all the European experiences, especially the negative ones - help us step up a level.

""Now we must go into the quarter-final with confidence and belief.""

Milan have turned around an abysmal start to the year and are now in fifth place in Serie A, equal on points with AS Roma who are in the fourth and last place that gives Champions League football next season.

""It is wonderful to play in the Champions League, gratifying and important for Milan. So either we win it, which would not be easy, or try to qualify by finishing in the top four in Serie A,"" Pioli said.

Milan have booked their spot in the last eight with Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Benfica, while the remaining four teams will be decided next week.

""We’ll be paired with a great opponent, but Tottenham are a big team too and we can always have our say. It is good to dream. Now we need to focus on Serie A, where we have some lost ground to make up.""

Tottenham never really threatened to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the first leg and went out with a whimper and boos from the home fans whose patience is running out.

Conte returned to the technical area after missing the last four games following gallbladder surgery but was as subdued as his team on a freezing night in north London.

In six Champions League campaigns with Juventus, Inter Milan, Chelsea and Tottenham, the Italian has only managed to reach the Champions League quarter-finals once.

And with his contract up in June, Wednesday's defeat felt like the beginning of the end of an era even if his side remain in contention to finish in the Premier League top four.

Whether or not Conte remains for the rest of the season is not certain, judging by his comments to Italy's Amazon Prime.

""I continue to work, I have a contract with Tottenham. I respect the contract. At the end of the season, assessments will be made with the club in the most serene way,"" he said.

""Let's see how the season ends. Maybe they can send me away even earlier. Perhaps the expectations were higher and may be disappointed. What matters for a coach is trying to work and raise the bar. This year we are struggling to raise the bar.""

Conte tried to talk about Tottenham's last-16 exit as progress, arguing that last season they were in the Europa Conference League, but the fans are unlikely to agree.

""We played in the Europa Conference League last year and weren't able to get out of the group stages. Now we took a step forward but it is not enough and if we want to be competitive,"" he said. ""We have to fight.""

Tottenham have now failed to score in their last three games, losing in the FA Cup to second-tier Sheffield United, to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League and now barely laying a glove on an average Milan side.

In his news conference later, Conte said he was sorry for the fans but that the club needed to go ""step by step"".

""I think the situation is very clear. I always say the same things we need time and patience. We don't have solid foundations to fight and win,"" Conte, who dragged Tottenham into fourth place in the Premier League last season, told reporters.

""We can't make a miracle and I can understand the fans losing patience because for a long time Tottenham have not won anything,"" he said. ""I'm really sorry for the fans but we cannot invent the win. It's important to know this.

""We have to build step by step.""",[],

Coach Christophe Galtier's star-studded team that includes striker Kylian Mbappe and world champion Lionel Messi failed to score against Bayern over two legs, losing 3-0 on aggregate and seeing their hopes of clinching Europe's top club trophy disappear for another year.

""It's a big disappointment,"" Galtier said. ""We have to deal with it and accept it. There's a lot of disappointment in the dressing room.""

""I don't know if it's a lesson to be learned, but there's a lot of frustration. If we'd scored first, it would have been different, but we didn't.""

PSG made a strong start and France forward Mbappe had an early opportunity before Messi went close with a double chance of his own in the 25th minute.

""We didn't open the scoring when we had the chance. We did well in the first half, we felt we could match our opponents, but we didn't put away our chances,"" said Galtier.

Instead it was Bayern who opened the scoring when Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting tapped-in in the 61st minute before a late second goal from Serge Gnabry sealed their win.

""We conceded what was a really stupid first goal at this level. Yes, there was pressure from Bayern, but sometimes you mustn't be ashamed to play it long to get over the pressing,"" Galtier said.

""When you're behind after an hour's play, it's difficult.""

His team's latest European failure - their fifth last-16 exit in seven years - adds pressure on Galtier, who refused to speculate on his future at the club.

""It's a big disappointment but we have to swallow it. It is too soon to talk about my future. I'm focused to the end of the season with a lot of energy and determination.""",[],

Jesus, who has scored five goals and chipped in seven assists for Arsenal following his £45 million (US$53.30 million) move from Manchester City in July, has been sidelined since he sustained a knee injury at the World Cup with Brazil, having surgery in early December.

""We will try not to rush him back, we will try to make a fair assessment between what he needs and when is comfortable,"" Arteta told reporters on Wednesday, ahead of their match at Sporting in the Europa League round of 16 on Thursday.

""Everything is going well, he needs time as well to get himself that confidence and that physical state that is necessary to compete with a free mind and once he’s free to do that, we will throw him in.""

Arteta said that Fabio Vieira had been suffering from a sore throat but would be available to play against Sporting.

Kieran Tierney, Eddie Nketiah and Leandro Trossard were absent from Wednesday's training, but Arteta said they were available for the match.

""Let’s see how they evolve. Obviously, we’ve had a few issues in the last few days and I am trying to accommodate everybody and get everyone in the best possible condition for tomorrow,"" Arteta said.

The match will be the fifth meeting between the two teams in European competition, with Arsenal yet to lose or concede a goal.

""The best way to prepare for any competition is to win the previous match and have that confidence and that proper emotion to approach the next game,"" Arteta said.

""Their strength is the idea of the manager, which is very clear. He (Ruben Amorim) has been very successful over the past years.

Rahm is the first player since Johnny Miller in 1975 to win three times in a calendar year before March and will headline a loaded field at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, which includes 44 of the top 50 players in the world.

The Spaniard, who opened the season with six consecutive top-10 finishes before settling for a share of 39th last week at Bay Hill, has never missed the cut in five starts at The Players and had his best result in 2021 when he finished ninth.

World number one Rahm counts the 2021 US Open among his 10 wins on the PGA Tour, but the Spaniard is very eager to add a Players Championship title to his resume.

""I mean, winning this event is a big step forward to a Hall of Fame career,"" Rahm told reporters. ""You are The Players Champion. Arguably as close as you can get to being a major champion without officially being one.""

Among the other contenders at TPC Sawgrass, where the winner will get US$4.5 million from a purse of US$25 million, are reigning PGA Tour Player of the Year Scottie Scheffler and four-times major winner Rory McIlroy.

For Scheffler and McIlroy, who have both spent time atop the world rankings this year, a win this week is one of the many scenarios in which they can return to top spot in the rankings.

McIlroy arrives full of confidence after finishing runner-up at Bay Hill where during the final round the Northern Irishman carded successive bogeys from the 14th before a two-putt birdie at the par-five 16th kept his hopes alive.

""As much as I was disappointed that I didn't play the final five holes the way I wanted to, it was still a good week, and I feel like getting into contention last week and sort of having those feelings sets me up well for this week,"" said McIlroy.

2019 TRIUMPH

McIlroy, who will play the first two rounds of the PGA Tour's flagship event alongside fellow major winners Rahm and Scheffler, has four top-10s in 12 starts at The Players, including his 2019 triumph.

Scheffler, who returned to world number one for a week in February after his successful title defense at the Phoenix Open, finished in a share of fourth at Bay Hill where he was also the defending champion.

Max Homa finished in a share of 13th place last year at TPC Sawgrass and will be liking his chances in what will be his third Players start given he is one of two golfers with multiple titles on the PGA Tour this season.

""This place is really tricky, so I think confidence is a big part of the week. It's nice to have that,"" said Homa, who moved to a career-best seventh in the world rankings this week.

""It's kind of fun to arrive at a massive event and not feel like I'm tinkering with anything or trying to do anything different.""

While there will plenty of star power at TPC Sawgrass, one glaring absence will be British Open champion and world number five Smith, who has been banned indefinitely from playing in PGA Tour events after switching to LIV Golf.

Australian Smith is one of five players who finished inside the top-10 last year at TPC Sawgrass who have since fled to LIV Golf, a group that also includes runner-up Anirban Lahiri, Dustin Johnson, Paul Casey and Harold Varner III.

In a civil complaint filed on Monday in a Florida state court in Martin County, Herman said she believes the agreement is ""invalid and unenforceable,"" according to her lawsuit. She did not accuse Woods specifically of harassment or assault in court papers.

""Because of the aggressive use of the Woods NDA against her by the defendant and the trust under his control, the plaintiff is unsure whether she may disclose, among other things, facts giving rise to various legal claims she believes she has,"" it added.

The complaint cited the Speak Out Act, a federal law signed by President Joe Biden in December 2022 that limits the enforcement of NDAs in cases of sexual harassment and assault.

It was a year ago at the tournament in the Southern California desert that the Pole began really to hit her stride amid a scorching 37-match winning streak.

Since then, the three-time Grand Slam champion has been the player to beat on tour.

""I feel like there is a little bit of a target on my back, which I didn't feel last year. So it's a different situation and I have to adjust to that,"" she told reporters at Indian Wells on Wednesday.

""On the other hand I've been number one for almost a year so I already have enough experience to deal with it.""

Learning to tune out the critics is another adjustment she has had to make.

The 21-year-old said she was taken aback by the negativity that came with her loss in the final of the Dubai Tennis Championships last month after she successfully defended her title in Doha.

""I lost in the final and people were surprised - not happy with the performance - and just critical,"" she said.

""It made me think that last year, before this huge streak and before winning all these tournaments, I would have been so happy with the result.

""But because of these comments right now, I felt like ooh, that's not enough. I'm trying not to read those kinds of things because I'm happy with the work I've put in and how I played in Doha and Dubai.""

Commonwealth Sport Canada (CSC) announced on Wednesday the Alberta bid, centred around the province's two biggest cities Calgary and Edmonton, as the preferred candidate after Hamilton's bid collapsed.

Hamilton, which hosted the first Commonwealth Games in 1930, had been considered the frontrunner to stage the centennial Games but was unable to obtain the required government backing by the CSC's Feb. 13th deadline.

""If there is one thing athletes and the sporting world know well it is the road to great achievement is never an easy one but it is one worth embarking on,"" said CSC president Claire Carver-Dias, in making the announcement. ""It is my distinct pleasure to announce that Alberta has been selected as Commonwealth Sport Canada's preferred candidate to bid for the 2030 Commonwealth Games.""

The Alberta government will contribute up to $2 million and the city of Edmonton another $1 million to the bid but Roger Jackson, president and CEO of the Alberta 2030 Commonwealth Games Corporation, could not provide a budget for the multi-sport event.

The CSC said it expects to complete the feasibility study in August when a decision will be made on whether to submit a formal bid.

""We are not ready yet to express exactly what that (budget) might be,"" said Jackson. ""We will be working with our government partners to come to a conclusion as to whether or not we advance a bid.""

Calgary hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics but saw hopes of bringing the 2026 Winter Games back to the city dashed when citizens voted resoundingly against it in a plebiscite, something current mayor Jyoti Gondek would not rule out happening again.

""I don't know where things are going to land through the exploration so not sure yet it will require a plebiscite,"" said Gondek. ""I am really hopeful people will see the value of this type of investment.""

If Canada does not put forward a bid it would be another blow for the Commonwealth Games Federation that has struggled to land hosts.

Both the Alberta and Hamilton bids said they were unaware of any other country expressing interest.

""One lady came up to me at Publix in Florida and said, 'Me and my husband were watching you last night on the Netflix show',"" Ruud told reporters on Wednesday, the first day of main draw action at Indian Wells.

""But it's not crazy. I haven't been an overnight worldwide superstar.""

One episode follows Ruud's run to the final of last year's French Open and depicts a heated exchange between the Norwegian and the grounds crew after he was not allowed to practise due to forecasted rain.

""I was quite angry honestly because the court crew wouldn't let us warm up before the match,"" Ruud said.

""I don't know if it was good or not but Netflix was there catching it all. It was something I almost forgot had happened,"" he said.

""But it was a little bit funny also, looking back on what can happen sometimes for us. It's not always a smooth ride.""

Canada's Auger Aliassime feels the impact of the show most acutely in the U.S., where Netflix has its biggest market.

""Going to dinner or a grocery store, a lot more people are recognizing me and other players,"" he said.

""They say, 'I just watched your episode and I loved it'. Nice interactions with people who maybe were not tennis fans before.""

Fritz's episode documented his breakthrough victory in the Indian Wells final last year and while he was happy with how it turned out, he said it may have given the wrong impressions about the ankle injury he played through in the title match.

""I thought the episode was really great but there were a couple things that were missed,"" the American said.

""I think the episode made it seem that my injury was in the warm-up before my match but it was at the end of my semi-final and I only realized how bad it felt the next day after.""

Ruud said he kept boundaries up between himself and the crew which limited his screen time.

""I didn't invite Netflix to too many personal things,"" he said.

""Inviting them to my hotel room, or having my girlfriend Maria talk on camera, that's not something she is so comfortable with. So there are many things that we said no to.

""Last year, there were things I told them. I said the issues that are with the car,"" Hamilton told BBC Radio 5 Live's Chequered Flag podcast.

""I've driven so many cars in my life so I know what a car needs. I know what a car doesn't need. I think it's really about accountability.

The 38-year-old failed to win a race last year, a career first for a season, but has dismissed suggestions he might be holding off on a new deal until he knew how competitive his car was.

He told the BBC that there was still time for Mercedes, whose run of eight successive constructors' titles ended last year, to turn the situation around.

""We're still multi world champions, you know? It's just we haven't got it right this time. We didn't get it right last year. But that doesn't mean we can't get it right moving forwards,"" he said.

The 20-year-old was handed a three-month sentence with one month suspended by the East Brabant District Court.

The match in Eindhoven was halted in the closing stages after the supporter ran on to the pitch and assaulted Dmitrovic, punching him in the face before being wrestled to the ground by the Serbian.

The man was serving a national stadium ban until 2026 imposed by the Dutch football association, but entered the ground with a ticket bought for him by a friend, PSV said.

He was also banned from being anywhere near the Philips Stadium when PSV play home matches for the next two years.

Lineker has hosted the BBC's flagship football show Match of the Day for more than 20 years and the charismatic 62-year-old has never been afraid to voice his opinions about political issues like Brexit.

As the BBC's highest-paid employee, Lineker is the face of its sports coverage.

Although the corporation has strict impartiality guidelines, that has not stopped Lineker from airing his views on Twitter where he has over 8.7 million followers.

Matters came to a head on Tuesday when Britain's interior minister Suella Braverman outlined proposals to stop almost all migrants crossing the Channel. Lineker described the policy as ""beyond awful"" and ""immeasurably cruel"".

Lineker wrote on Twitter that the language used in the proposals was not dissimilar to that of Nazi Germany, forcing the BBC to have a ""frank conversation"" with the presenter after Braverman's complaint.

Lineker doubled down on Wednesday, saying he would continue to speak for those who had no voice.

""I have never known such love and support in my life than I'm getting this morning (England World Cup goals aside, possibly). I want to thank each and every one of you,"" he added on Twitter.

Reuters has contacted the BBC for comment.

PROLIFIC STRIKER

As a footballer, Lineker's poaching instincts made him one of the most prolific strikers in the game, although major silverware eluded him.

He made his professional debut for Leicester City in 1978-79 and went on to make over 500 club appearances for the Foxes, Everton, Barcelona, Tottenham Hotspur and Japanese side Nagoya Grampus Eight, scoring nearly 300 goals.

He earned his first England cap in 1984 and by the time he retired was the country's second-highest scorer with 48 goals, behind Bobby Charlton. Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane have since overtaken both.

Lineker played 80 times for his country and his four goals at the 1990 World Cup despite being unwell propelled England to the semi-finals.

Having also top-scored at the 1986 World Cup with six goals, no English player has come close to eclipsing his record of 10 goals at football's global showpiece event, earning him a spot in English Football's Hall of Fame.

Following his retirement, Lineker embarked on a media career, working as a football pundit before taking over as Match of the Day host while also writing columns for British newspapers.

Midway through the 2015-16 campaign, Lineker went viral on social media when he promised to present Match of the Day wearing just his underwear if his former club Leicester went on to win the Premier League title.

Leicester beat overwhelming odds to lift the trophy and Lineker duly kept his word, presenting the first Match of the Day of the following season wearing nothing but white boxer shorts.",[],

Fellow internationals Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Kadidiatou Diani have also said they were taking a step back from the national team.

Renard was stripped of the France captaincy by Diacre following the side's quarter-final exit at Euro 2017, before regaining it in 2021.

""... I have been the subject of a smear campaign that is astonishing in its violence and dishonesty,"" Diacre said in a statement issued by her lawyer.

""My detractors have not hesitated to attack my personal and professional integrity, without bothering with the truth, four months before the World Cup.

""I will not let myself be affected by this destabilisation operation, which does not take into account my sporting record, and which has as its sole objective a personal settlement of scores.""

The French Football Federation (FFF) did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

Schools will be expected to deliver a minimum of two hours of PE (physical education) per week and ensure that girls have equal access to all school sport, including soccer.

""An announcement that will change women's football in England forever, and the start of something truly special,"" the Lionesses said in a statement. ""We see this as only the beginning.""

A clinical 2-0 victory at Wembley got the Old Trafford trophy cabinet door swinging open again though and, perhaps more importantly, gave a glimpse of greater things to come under astute Dutch manager Erik ten Hag.

The former Ajax Amsterdam boss arrived at Old Trafford with the club in a state of some turmoil on and off the pitch after finishing in sixth place in the Premier League last season.

But while there is little he can do about the future ownership of the 20-time English champions, which the American Glazer family have expressed a wish to sell, on the pitch he is shaping a team that looks capable of reviving the glory days.

A season that began under a Cristiano Ronaldo-shaped cloud has been transformed since the Portuguese talisman was finally shown the door after a toxic fall-out.

Ten Hag has quietly gone about his business, moulding an intelligent team that works tirelessly and is beginning to make winning a habit. A sixth League Cup triumph ended the club's longest wait for a trophy since 1983.

And the season could still get better. They are in the fifth round of the FA Cup, the last 16 of the Europa League after knocking out Barcelona in midweek and in third place in the Premier League and not out of the title race.

Ten Hag experienced some difficult early days. A 4-0 hammering at Brentford in August had some predicting he might be out before the leaves fell off the trees and then there was a humiliating 6-3 defeat at Manchester City.

Since that drubbing at The Etihad in early October, United have lost only twice in all competitions, forward Marcus Rashford has turned into a world-beater and the signing of midfielder Casemiro has looked like a stroke of genius.

A defence built around the terrier-like Lisandro Martinez and the cultured Raphael Varane snuffed out Newcastle on Sunday, winger Antony is becoming a fan favourite and even old-fashioned centre forward Wout Weghorst, a puzzling signing at the time, looks as though he would run through brick walls for Ten Hag.",[],

A header by Casemiro followed by an own goal by Sven Botman late in the first half silenced the hordes of Newcastle fans who flocked to the capital full of optimism as Manchester United went on to lift the trophy for a sixth time with relative ease.

Much of the build-up was about Newcastle's first appearance in a major final since 1999 and an uptick in their fortunes instigated by Eddie Howe since a 2021 Saudi Arabia-led takeover.

But Erik ten Hag's resurgent United side showed them how far they still need to go as they claimed the club's first trophy since winning the Europa League under Jose Mourinho in 2017 - their longest wait for silverware since 1983.

""It has been an amazing period, first trophy of the season but we want more it is not enough for this club, we want more and we need more because our standards demand more,"" Bruno Fernandes, who was denied a third goal in stoppage time, said.

""For me it was about winning trophies and finally we did it. I am satisfied but I want more. I want much more.""

There was little between the sides in a scrappy first half but the English season's first silverware was effectively decided in the space of six minutes towards halftime.

Newcastle were stunned when Brazilian Casemiro met a superb Luke Shaw free kick in the 33rd minute to head past Loris Karius, the goal allowed to stand after a VAR check for offside.

Six minutes later Newcastle were left totally deflated when the in-form Marcus Rashford was played in down the left and his shot deflected over a helpless Karius for what initially appeared to be his 17th goal since the World Cup.

However, it was credited to the unfortunate Botman.

Kicking towards their fans in the second half Newcastle roused themselves into action and pinned a leggy-looking United back at times but they rarely looked like scoring.

Newcastle's fans, who had created a sea of black and white with give-away plastic flags at the stadium's west side during the closing minutes, drifted away before the presentation.

The Tyneside club has now lost each of their last nine matches at Wembley, a run that began in the 1974 FA Cup final.

Instead the stage was left for United whose fans were in full voice as Bruno Fernandes raised the trophy which they hope will be the first of many under Dutchman Ten Hag whose first season goes from strength to strength after some difficult early days.",[],

Seconds after the break, Skipp picked up a clearance by Chelsea's British record signing Enzo Fernandez and fired in from more than 20 yards, his shot going in off the bar after Kepa Arrizabalaga could not get enough of a hand on it.

Kane secured the three points for Spurs when he pounced at the far post after a corner by Son Heung-min was flicked on by Eric Dier in the 82nd minute.

Mbappe, who bagged a double, was set up by Messi for both his goals, and repaid the favour by laying on another for the Argentine forward as PSG, who were without the injured Neymar, moved to 60 points from 25 games with second-placed Marseille on 52.

France forward Mbappe, who was on the losing side against Messi's Argentina in the World Cup final, became PSG's joint record scorer with 200 goals - level with Edinson Cavani - while Messi netted his 700th in club football.

""We were aggressive, we put intensity into the game, that's what we'd been missing,"" said PSG centre back Sergio Ramos.

Marseille coach Igor Tudor said he did not regret his side's high-risk approach.

""Why should we have changed our way of playing? It has been working well this season,"" he said.

""Mbappe's presence didn't change anything. His presence made it more difficult for us to play our game but we were not going to change it.""

Third-placed Monaco slumped to a 3-0 home defeat against Nice, who prevailed thanks to a Terem Moffi double and a superb half-volley by Khephren Thuram.

The result left Monaco on 50 points, ahead of fourth-placed RC Lens on goals scored after the northerners drew 1-1 at Montpellier on Saturday.

PSG, who were knocked out of the French Cup in the last 16 by Marseille earlier this month, ended a three-game losing streak in all competitions by beating Lille last weekend and they were focused throughout at the Velodrome.

They suffered an early injury blow when Presnel Kimpembe, who missed the World Cup for France with an Achilles issue, left the pitch on a stretcher, two weeks after making his comeback from a three-month layoff.

Matteo Guendouzi created danger as Marseille pressed high and hard but they were exposed on the counter and the hosts were punished in the 25th minute when Messi played Mbappe through for the France forward to race into the area and beat Pau Lopez with a low shot.

The roles were reversed four minutes later as Mbappe delivered a pin-point cross for Messi, who tapped in from point-blank range to double the advantage in front of an all-time Ligue 1 record attendance of 65,800.

Messi then missed a sitter and Mbappe was denied by Lopez after being found in the area by the Argentine again, just before Marquinhos's angled shot went just wide as Marseille were again caught on the break.

Messi beautifully lifted the ball into the path of Mbappe, who volleyed home with his left foot for his 16th goal of the season in Ligue 1.

Gianluigi Donnarumma made a spectacular save from Nuno Tavares's header in the 67th to snuff out any hope of a Marseille comeback as PSG secured a first clean sheet in six league games.

Almeria halted Barca's seven game winning streak in the league and delivered another blow to the Catalans who, after going unbeaten in 18 matches in all competitions, have now lost two straight matches after being knocked out of the Europa League on Thursday.

The hosts were the better side in the first half and scored after 24 minutes when Luis Suarez sent a perfect long pass to Toure who was ghosting behind Barca's defence. The Malian striker ran towards the area and hit a thunderous strike in off the crossbar.

It was only the eighth goal Barcelona have conceded in La Liga this season, the least of any team in the top five leagues in Europe.

Almeria should have extended their lead but Leo Baptistao's strike was blocked by goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Rodrigo Ely then missed a sitter from close-range, sending wide a header from a corner when he was all alone in the area.

""I'm very angry because I think we made the worst game of the season by far, mainly in the first half,"" Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez told Movistar Plus.

""We were not good and wasted a great opportunity in a match we could not afford to lose after what happened to Real Madrid.

At the same ground where their title aspirations were dealt a fatal blow last season, Riccardo Orsolini's goal condemned Inter to another loss.

Simone Inzaghi's team are second in the standings on 47 points from 24 matches, 18 behind leaders Napoli who beat Empoli 2-0 on Saturday.

Inter will also be looking over their shoulders with concern at AC Milan and AS Roma, who are level on 44 points and are yet to play in this round of fixtures. Bologna are seventh on 35 points.

Bologna thought they had taken the lead at a rain-sodden Stadio Renato Dall'Ara through Musa Barrow in the 12th minute, only for the effort to be ruled out following a VAR review.

Minutes later, Roberto Soriano rattled the woodwork on the rebound after Andre Onana had parried Andrea Cambiaso's volley into his path.

Inzaghi, missing Federico Dimarco, Milan Skriniar and Joaquin Correa through injury, rested Nicolo Barella among a raft of changes from their midweek Champions League win over Porto, and his much-changed Inter team lacked fluidity.

They had brief spells of possession in the first half, but created few clear-cut chances as Lautaro Martinez headed an Alessandro Bastoni cross just wide of the target and Henrikh Mkhitaryan twice fired over the bar.

Bologna continued to press forward after the break, and Andre Onana kept his side in the game with two crucial saves in quick succession, getting a hand to a Soriano shot before smothering Dominguez's effort from the edge of the area.

Romelu Lukaku and substitute Edin Dzeko each had a shot on target, but it was Bologna who broke the deadlock in the 76th minute when Orsolini raced on to Jerdy Schouten's pass and powered a shot into the net.

""An incredible match in which many things happened. They cancelled a goal for us, we put Inter down by playing really well and we are satisfied,"" Orsolini told DAZN.

""Schouten put a ball to me, I took advantage of the bounce to bring the ball forward with my chest and in front of Onana I tried to place it under the crossbar.""

Odion Ighalo scored four and Moussa Marega netted twice while Salem Al Dawsari was also on target for the four-time winners from Saudi Arabia, who will now take on Urawa over two legs on April 29 and May 6.

The pair last met in 2019 when Al Hilal avenged a loss to the J.League side in the 2017 final and Maciej Skorza's side will face a major challenge to deny Al Hilal a record fifth title.

Ighalo put Al Hilal in front with barely 90 seconds on the clock when Mohammed Kanno's persistence set up the former Manchester United striker with the simplest of headed finishes, and the onslaught soon gathered unstoppable momentum.

The Nigerian added a second in the 10th minute having seen Al Duhail goalkeeper Salah Zakaria deny him five minutes earlier.

But when Brazilian winger Michael Oliveira centred, after being released down the right by defender Jang Hyun-soo, Ighalo made no mistake.

Four minutes later Marega slotted in following Al Dawsari's centre from the left and the Mali international made it 4-0 in the 28th minute when he latched onto goalkeeper Abdullah Al Mauoif's long punt down the middle.

Al Dawsari hit his side's fifth seven minutes before the interval when he swept in Marega's clever backheel and the former Porto forward thought he had claimed a sixth for his side, only for his volley to be ruled out by VAR for offside.

Ighalo ensured there was to be no respite for Al Duhail at the start of the second half when he clipped the ball over Zakaria to complete his hat-trick three minutes after the interval.

He then hit his fourth in the 62nd minute, converting from Abdullah Al Hamdan's cut-back to put the seal on the most comprehensive win and keep Al Hilal on track to become the first team to claim back-to-back titles since Al Ittihad in 2005.",[],

Bristol City, who are managed by Nigel Pearson, have been unbeaten in all competitions since the last week of December, moving up to 13th in the second-tier Championship.

The last time the two teams faced each other at Ashton Gate, Manchester City edged Bristol City 3-2 in the League Cup semi-finals second leg in 2018 en route to Guardiola's first trophy with the English club.

""From my experience in this country, in the last six years, when you go (play) away in the FA cup at a Championship team, it is always, always tough. (Playing at) home is a little different,"" Guardiola told reporters ahead of Tuesday's clash.

""Last 12 games - no defeat. That means they are there. My scouts are saying it's a good team. The manager has experience, did really well with Leicester (City) and Watford when he was there one or two seasons ago.

""It's a final. The FA cup is a really, really important competition, so it's a serious team we will play tomorrow.""

Manchester City bounced back from two consecutive draws to beat Bournemouth 4-1 over the weekend but Guardiola feels the team can play better as they sit two points behind league leaders Arsenal, who have a game in hand.

""The way we are playing is good, results could be better. Sometimes it happens in football,"" Guardiola said.

""I have no complaints about how we are playing and how we are fighting. The mood in the locker room is exceptional and the guys are doing everything - that is enough for me.

""I have the feeling in the Premier League many things are going to happen, everyone is going to drop points. But we cannot drop any, we want to fight until the end.""

The Caribbean side are coming off a 1-0 series win in Zimbabwe earlier this month, but before that were thumped in Australia late last year and will face similar seamer-friendly conditions on their short tour of South Africa.

""It won’t be easy, South Africa are a tough team at home, but we are looking forward to playing some hard days of test cricket,"" Brathwaite told reporters on Monday.

""It is important we take control of every hour, and not look at the big picture, just go from session to session.""

West Indies have lost 12 of their previous 15 tests in South Africa and won just one, though this is the first time they have toured the country in the longest format since 2015. Their only victory was a surprise success in Gqeberha 16 years ago.

Brathwaite, who opens the batting, concedes it will be a big step up from what they faced in Zimbabwe and it will be up to the batters to lay the platform for success against the home side's vaunted pace attack on helpful wickets.

""Zimbabwe isn’t a top team in the world so we are really looking to challenging ourselves here. We need to improve as batters and it is important as openers to set the foundation or the team,"" he said.

""It looks a good wicket, stats say batters can get runs on this pitch and the spinners will turn it later in the game.

Can Mercedes' seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton add to his record tally of 103 victories?

There are plenty of storylines to the season that starts in Bahrain on March 5. The following looks at some of them.

TRIPLE MAX

Verstappen will start as favourite for a third title in a row. The Dutch driver won 15 races last year. How many can he bag this time? And can team mate Sergio Perez get closer to him?

NEW BOSSES

Four of the 10 teams have new principals since 2022.

Fred Vasseur has replaced Mattia Binotto at Ferrari, joining from Sauber/Alfa Romeo in January.

McLaren's Andreas Seidl has joined Sauber, appointing Alessandro Alunni Bravo to what is effectively a principal role, with Andrea Stella stepping up at McLaren while James Vowles moved from a strategy role at Mercedes to boss of Williams.

FERRARI

Can Vasseur bring a title to Maranello for the first time since the 2008 constructors' championship?

The Frenchman's arrival has drawn comparisons with compatriot Jean Todt, who led the team through a golden era with Michael Schumacher in the early 2000s.

NEW FACES

There are three rookies on the grid.

Australian Oscar Piastri joined McLaren in controversial circumstances after a contract dispute with Alpine while Nyck de Vries has replaced Pierre Gasly (now with Alpine) at Red Bull-owned AlphaTauri.

Logan Sargeant will meanwhile be making his debut at Williams as the first grand prix racer from the United States since Alexander Rossi in 2015.

OLD FACES

Nico Hulkenberg starts his comeback at Haas, his first full season drive since 2019, with the German still chasing a first podium finish after 179 starts.

Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, now 41, and Hamilton, 38, are the oldest drivers. Can either become the first driver to win a race after reaching the milestone of 300 starts? Alonso has made 355, Hamilton 310.

LAS VEGAS

Las Vegas promises to be the big and brash event of the year with a Saturday night race on the Strip in November as the penultimate round of the season and the hype in over-drive.

Formula One's popularity in America is already surging thanks to Netflix series 'Drive to Survive'.

NEW TEAMS

Andretti Cadillac are seeking to become the 11th team on the grid from 2026. Will the sport let them in?

MERCEDES

Mercedes, champions eight years in a row, had a tough 2022 with a 'porpoising' car that proved hard to handle. Can they close the gap to Red Bull and Ferrari?

NEW DEAL

Hamilton is out of contract at the end of the year and talks on a new one have started. He will be asked about it regularly.

SPEAKING OUT

The governing FIA has tweaked the rules on drivers making political, personal and religious statements. How will they and the stewards react?

35,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/french-football-bracing-itself-black-tuesday-3309396,French football bracing itself for Black Tuesday,"PARIS : French football is bracing itself for a major shakedown as both the president of the federation (FFF) and the women's head coach are expected to resign from their positions on Tuesday.

Noel Le Graet, who has been head of the FFF since 2011, has already taken a step back amid a legal investigation into alleged sexual and moral harassment and a damning audit commissioned by the Sports ministry, will be at the centre of Tuesday's executive committee.

Should he refuse to step down, Le Graet, 81, could be brought before the FFF's disciplinary committee or the executive committee could resign to force new elections.

""Given the failures in governance, his seriously inappropriate behaviour towards women, I can only agree with the conclusion of the report: he no longer has the legitimacy to administer and represent French soccer,"" Sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera said earlier this month.

Le Graet, who also came under fire when he made dismissive comments about France great Zinedine Zidane after extending men's coach Didier Deschamps's contract until 2026, could be followed into the abyss by the women's coach, Corinne Diacre.

Diacre's position has become untenable since team captain Wendie Renard said last week that she would not play at this year's Women's World Cup to preserve her mental health.

Fellow internationals Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Kadidiatou Diani following suit soon after her announcement, all saying they were taking a step back from the national team.

Renard, who is widely considered one of the best defenders in women's football, played for France in international games against Norway, Denmark and Uruguay earlier this month.

According to a report in French multimedia outlet RMC Sport, Renard will not play for the national team as long as Diacre is in charge.

The 48-year-old Diacre, who in 2014 became the first French woman to coach a men's team when she took charge of then Ligue 2 side Clermont, was appointed France head coach in 2017.

Renard was stripped of the captaincy by Diacre following their quarter-final exit at Euro 2017, before regaining it in 2021.

Diacre had previously attracted criticism from other French players, including Gaetane Thiney and Sarah Bouhaddi.

The coach was also criticised at the European Championship in England last year for leaving out influential senior players Amandine Henry and Eugenie Le Sommer, their all-time leading goalscorer (86 goals), in her squad of 23.

France were eliminated in the semi-finals by Germany.

""I can no longer support the current system, which is far from the requirements of the highest level,"" said Renard.

South Africa lost four tests in a row prior to a rain-affected draw in Australia earlier this year, though they were on their way to defeat in that match too.

The batting remains the major concern with the side having not scored more than 255 in any of their last 10 innings, which has led to recalls for Aiden Markram and Ryan Rickelton, and a potential first cap for Tony de Zorzi.

""It's the start of a new journey and we start with a clean slate. We want to go out there and play the way we want to play. It’s going to be exciting to see how that looks on the field,"" Bavuma told reporters on Monday.

""The batting unit (struggled) in the last two series in England and Australia, but those are tough tours, generally ones that separate the good guys from the really good guys.

""The guys who are still here want to man up as the batting unit, we need to score runs to give the bowlers the room to do what they need to do.""

South Africa will likely play an extra batsman at number seven with Heinrich Klaasen to keep wicket, and go in with an all pace attack on the bouncy Highveld wicket in Pretoria.

""That will still be decided by the coach (Shukri Conrad). We have resources whether we decide to go with a pace (bowling) attack, or with a spin attack. We can back up whatever tactic we go with.""

Bavuma made his test debut against the West Indies in 2014 and admits they are a special opponent for him.

""West Indies was the team I supported growing up. So there is that sentiment when it comes to them. I made 10 runs on my debut so that was nothing to write home about, hopefully this (first game as captain) goes better.

""They play old fashioned cricket. Batters grind it out, bowlers are looking to hit their areas outside off stump. They have guys who can stand up to the challenge.

""Their bowling attack has guys who can get the ball through (quickly), which is something you need in South Africa.""",[],

The 35-year-old, a three-times Grand Slam champion, is no stranger to hip problems and was on the verge of retirement in 2019 after having surgery the previous year.

However, he got his career back on track after another operation and stormed into his fourth ATP final since returning to the tour at last week's Qatar Open where he was beaten by Daniil Medvedev.

""We regret to inform you that Andy Murray is unable to participate in this year's tournament,"" Dubai organisers said in a post on Twitter. ""Andy has been dealing with a recurring hip injury that has unfortunately forced him out of Dubai.""

Murray said after his defeat by Medvedev that he would have to manage his body better, especially after physically demanding matches.

""At my age and with some of the issues that I've got, I do have to be mindful of those things. I cannot just keep going until something happens,"" Murray said.

The former captain hit paceman James Anderson through midwicket for four with the fourth ball of the morning at Wellington's Basin Reserve on day four to pass Taylor's mark of 7,683 runs.

By tea, Williamson had chalked up his 26th century in tests to give the hosts some hope of pulling off an unlikely win after they were asked to follow on.

As always, the mild-mannered 32-year-old from Tauranga kept the emotions in check, barely acknowledging the warm applause from the crowd after taking the runs record.

Later in the day, after being caught behind for 132 off Harry Brook's part-time medium pace, Williamson showed he has lost none of his discomfort talking about his achievements.

""It's not something that I've sort of thought about a whole lot but it is an honour,"" he told reporters of the record.

""I look at that list and I've admired all of those players over the years, whether that's watching from afar growing up or playing alongside a number of them as well.

""It's not a focus point, but it's special to be amongst that company.""

A nation of 5 million, New Zealand has produced a slew of brilliant cricketers over the decades but none have made their mark with the bat quite like Williamson.

Taylor's tally of runs came from 112 matches, while Williamson, now on 7,787 runs at an average of 53.33, is playing his 92nd test.

Former team mate Taylor, who retired last year, was quick to congratulate him.

""This achievement is a testament to your hard work and dedication to test cricket, of which I was privy to for a number of years,"" he said.

""Here’s to many more.""

Williamson managed only 10 runs across his three previous innings of the series against England but answered the team's call for a big score on Monday.

He batted superbly through a 282-ball knock, anchoring partnerships with Henry Nicholls (29), Daryl Mitchell (54) and Tom Blundell (90) in New Zealand's second innings of 483.

Tim Southee's side will bid to record just the fourth win in history by a team asked to follow on.

Should they pull it off, they will have their quiet talisman Williamson to thank for setting up the chance.

""I think we can ask a number of questions coming in to day five,"" he said.

The left-armer suffered the injury to the middle finger of his bowling hand and was sidelined as Australia lost the opening two tests of the four-match series against India.

With skipper Pat Cummins and batter David Warner ruled out of the contest, the tourists are likely to welcome back Starc and all-rounder Cameron Green.

""There's going to be a level of discomfort for a while, I don't think it is going to be 100 per cent for a fair while,"" Starc said on Monday. ""But it's certainly good enough. The ball's coming out quite nicely and I feel I'm pretty much at full tilt.

""It wouldn't be the first test match I've played in some sort of discomfort. If I only played when I was at 100 per cent I would have only played five or 10 tests.

""I'm happy with where it's at and I've got enough of a pain threshold to deal with that stuff over the last 10 or 12 years.""

Cummins has returned home to be with his ailing mother, leaving Steve Smith, who captained Australia between 2015 and 2018, to lead the side in his absence.

Starc felt the quicks still had a big role to play in the series, which has so far favoured the spinners.

""It's been a challenge in the last couple of weeks, the first two tests,"" he said.

""We do see spin playing a huge part in this test series but the quicks have still played a particular role, whether it be with the new ball, if it does reverse-swing, and being able to bowl that skiddy ball and bring the stumps into play.

""So there's certainly an important role to play for the seam bowlers.""

'NOT UNPLAYABLE'

Indian wicketkeeper Srikar Bharat said the turning wickets that have so far proven to be big challenges for Australia were not totally unplayable.

Bharat scored an unbeaten 23 off 22 deliveries to take India home in the second test in New Delhi and said his mindset was to keep things simple.

""The wickets aren't unplayable,"" said Bharat. ""If you apply yourself and back your defence, there's scope for a batsman to score runs.

The visitors defended superbly after Real centre back Eder Militao scored an own goal in the first half, managing to overcome the loss of key players like Robert Lewandowski, Pedri and Ousmane Dembele who missed the game due to injuries.

Barca earned a much-needed win after arriving in the Spanish capital under pressure having been knocked out of the Europa League and losing at lowly Almeria to halt a seven-game winning streak in LaLiga.

""We would have liked to have the ball more, to control de game a little more but we fought hard and competed in a high level. They had the ball but didn’t create many chances. We got the advantage for the second leg and that’s really important,"" Barcelona captain Sergio Busquets told TVE.

Real Madrid started better and dominated the first 15 minutes, but Barcelona started to turn things around as they took control the midfield and their defensive game plan worked brilliantly.

Barca centre back Ronald Araujo did a great job at right back to neutralise the threat of the dangerous Vinicius Jr. and Karim Benzema was left alone up front.

Real became frustrated and tempers flared before the hosts made the crucial mistake which gave Barca the winner.

Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga gifted a back pass to Ferran Torres who reacted quickly to slide the ball to Franck Kessie.

His point-blank strike was saved but bounced off Militao and into the net.

The assistant referee signalled offside but the VAR replay showed Kessie was fractionally onside and the goal stood.

Barcelona locked Real Madrid into an even tighter situation during the second half and although the hosts dominated possession, they rarely threatened to equalise.

Real did not record a single shot on target despite having almost 70 per cent of possession in the second half and Barca should have extended their lead in the 71st minute when a Kessie shot that beat the goalkeeper was blocked by Ansu Fati.

Substitute Rodrygo had Real’s best chance with a late long-range strike that flew narrowly wide of the post.

The 35-year-old Serbian won in Adelaide before sealing his 22nd Grand Slam trophy at the Australian Open while managing a hamstring injury and has hit top form after a slow start in Dubai on his return to the tour.

Having breezed through the first set on the back of a single break, Djokovic found the going a bit tougher in the next as the big-serving Hurkacz raised his game in search of a first win over the world number one in their fifth meeting.

After a crucial hold from 0-30 down to draw level at 5-5, Djokovic grabbed another break to heap the pressure on Hurkacz and the five-times champion closed out the match on serve.

""It was a challenging match as it always is against Hubert,"" Djokovic said. ""I think he's got one of the best serves in the game. In the second set, until the 11th game I didn't have too many chances against his serve.

""Fortunately for me, I also found the rhythm on my serve... one or two points can decide the winner in matches like these.

""I'm really glad with the way I played under pressure.""

Alexander Zverev earlier reached his first semi-final since last year's French Open with a 7-5 6-4 win over Lorenzo Sonego.

The seventh seed has had a torrid time after injuring his ankle at Roland Garros and undergoing surgery, only returning to the ATP tour in December after suffering a bone edema problem during his rehabilitation.

""It's been a very difficult time for me over the last nine months,"" world number 16 Zverev said. ""I haven't played tennis at all for such a long period for the first time in my life.

Aston Martin driver Alonso's first appearance for now-defunct Minardi was the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on Mar 4, 2001. Piastri was born in the same city on April 6 of that year.

While Piastri makes his debut, the race will be Alonso's record-extending 356th F1 start.

""Privileged to still drive here, better than ever. I have no concerns on age yet,"" Alonso, 41, told reporters at the Sakhir circuit with Piastri sitting in the same FIA press conference for the first time as a Formula One driver.

Piastri, who was reserve to Alonso at Renault-owned Alpine last season, returned the compliment.

""On paper, it sounds a little bit strange ... for Fernando's career to be longer than I've been alive but it's a big privilege to race against someone like Fernando.""

Bavuma, 32, was installed as the new test skipper just weeks before the two-test series when Dean Elgar was stripped of the job after heavy defeats in both England and Australia over the last six months for South Africa.

But while Bavuma led his side to a comfortable 87-run win over the West Indies on Thursday, his own performance left much to be desired.

He earned the unwanted distinction of becoming the fourth player to get a pair of ducks on his test captaincy debut after Mark Taylor (Australia), Rashid Latif (Pakistan) and Habibul Bashar (Bangladesh).

Bavuma was dismissed second ball in the first innings and first ball in the second innings, which will fuel the debate over his place in the team and continuing to select a batsman who has scored a single century in 95 test innings.

But he was not the only failure with the bat as South Africa, who had won the toss, elected to bat and score 342 in the first innings only to wilt in the second innings and make 116.

It set the West Indies a target of 247 runs but they fell well short as the pace bowlers dominated the contest.

“We did not get many partnerships. The wicket did not get easier, there was variable bounce,” said Bavuma.

“But our lead eventually proved to be a lot. The bowlers need to rest, it was a big effort from them. The batters need to get together and work on our game plan. We need to do better next time,” he said after the victory.

The seven times world champion was asked about human rights in Bahrain and neighbouring Saudi Arabia, which hosts the second round.

It was the first time he had faced the media at a grand prix since the re-wording of the international sporting code last December to require written permission to make or display ""political, religious and personal statements or comments"".

The new rules cover podium ceremonies and anthems but drivers can make statements ""in their own space"" such as social media and official news conferences in response to direct questions.

Hamilton has said nothing will stop him speaking out.

""I’ve always felt that we have a responsibility and if the sport is going to go to these countries we are duty bound to raise awareness and try to leave a positive impact in these places,"" he told reporters in the Mercedes hospitality at Sakhir.

""That view has not always been shared within the sport, whether its teams or people in high-powered positions, but more needs to be done without doubt.

""Whether or not that will happen, time will tell.""

Asked about the human rights situation in Bahrain and Formula One's impact, he said he was ""not sure it’s got better while I’ve been coming all these years.""

The Briton was speaking in a crowded room with only three female reporters among the men - an imbalance he was also happy to speak out on.

""This sport still has a lot more work to do in the diversity space,"" he said when asked about the general absence of female figures in the latest run of the popular Netflix docu-series 'Drive to Survive'.

""It’s definitely not good ... there are a lot of women out there that are watching Drive to Survive that are watching the sport.

""If they are not seeing that it’s possible for them to be there, or there’s a place for them there, that’s counter-intuitive to our values and what should be. It is still very much a male-dominated space,"" he added.

""I'm trying to get 8,000 girls into the sport. We need everybody to be doing that up and down the pitlane because 100 per cent girls and women belong here equally as much as the men do.""",[],

The sport's most successful driver of all time, now 38, is out of contract at the end of the season that starts in Bahrain on Sunday but has said a new deal will be done.

Hill, the 1996 world champion, wrote in a recent column for the Daily Telegraph newspaper that Hamilton might be ""less-minded to sign a new long-term deal"" if the car were miles off the pace.

Button, 2009 champion, was quoted by the Independent as saying his fellow-Briton could be tempted to retire if the wins dried up.

Seven times champion Hamilton told reporters at Sakhir on Thursday that ""it's ultimately people creating rumours without facts.

""It's never helpful, and you would have thought that they would both know me by now,"" he added.

""I have been with Mercedes since I was 13... and whether or not we have a difficult year this year, I will still be here. I am a fighter and we fight as a team.

""I love the challenge of finding solutions and I still believe I am able to put the car in places that perhaps others are not able to.

""There is no hold up with our contract, I've always been very relaxed. I don't feel like I have to get it done right this second.""

Red Bull's double world champion Max Verstappen is chasing his third successive title and his car looked comfortably quicker than the rest in testing last week.

The Dutch 25-year-old was asked on Thursday where the new car was better than the one that won 17 of 22 races last year and replied: ""everywhere"".

Mercedes are confident they have fixed the 'porpoising' problems that troubled them last year but remain off the pace.

Hamilton said the team had dived deep into the data and he had been involved on calls every day.

""I knew from the moment I drove the car where we were and the challenges we would be facing,"" he said.

""On a positive, not having the bouncing this year is a huge plus ... now we can focus on just pure performance.""",[],

Barcelona approved a 35-year debt plan in a referendum of club members in 2021 that would enable them to renovate their iconic but languishing Camp Nou stadium and its surroundings.

The preliminary debt structure has been revised, the Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) said in reports published on its website, with Barca to make a final repayment in 2047 instead of 2052 as previously agreed..

The original plan represented the only source of funding for the Nou Camp project. Under the amended structure, notes would be issued for €1.3 billion, with the remainder of the deal made up of a 200 million euros bank loan maturing in 2028, the KBRA report said.

KBRA said the revised structure included additional refinancing and interest rate risk and as a result it had downgraded the financing plan's rating from BBB+ to BBB, meaning it is less attractive to investors.

A source at the club confirmed the revised debt structure but said the terms of the deal were still being negotiated with Goldman Sachs and that the definitive deal would be announced by Mar 31.

Goldman Sachs has not replied to a request for more information about the ongoing talks and the new terms.

Camp Nou is the largest football stadium in Europe and the fourth largest in the world by capacity with 99,354 seats but the club considers it no longer offers a full match-day experience for fans.

The club estimates the new stadium will allow Barca to generate 200 million euros of additional revenue annually through sponsorship and naming rights, ticketing, catering, VIP boxes, hospitality, meetings and events.

Barcelona have announced that Turkish construction company Limak will carry out the renovation and work will start in June.

Club president Joan Laporta, who presided over one of Barca's most successful periods from 2003 to 2010, was re-elected two years ago after the previous board resigned due to the club's worsening finances and other issues.

He inherited a club deep in a financial crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Restricted by LaLiga's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, Barca were unable to agree a new deal with club great Lionel Messi, who left as a free agent to Paris St Germain in 2021.

Since then Laporta has tried to improve the club's financial situation, turning the club's assets into cash and bringing in new sponsors.

In March 2022, the club signed a shirt and stadium sponsorship deal with audio streaming platform Spotify (SPOT.N) in an agreement worth 280 million euros.

Barca have also agreed to sell a 25 per cent stake in their La Liga TV rights for the next 25 years to US private equity group Sixth Street for 607.5 million euros and approved the sale of a minority share of their audio-visual division to Socios.com and Orpheus Media for 200 million.",[],

The 24-year-old will try his hand at hitting home runs at the Cardinals camp in Florida as part of a new ambassadorial role with MLB Europe.

""I'm intrigued to see how different it is to cricket and what similarities there are too - will a home run feel as good as hitting a six?"" Brook said in an MLB news release on Thursday.

Nash, 45, tested positive for the appetite stimulant capromorelin after providing an out-of-competition urine sample on Oct. 24 2022, USADA said.

Capromorelin is not specifically listed on WADA's ""Prohibited List"" but is considered by the global anti-doping body to be a non-specified substance in the class of peptide hormones, growth factors, related substances and mimetics.

It is banned at all times under USADA and International Cycling Union anti-doping protocols.

California-based Nash provided records of a prescription liquid pet medication containing capromorelin.

""She was administering the medication orally to her dog each day during the final weeks of her pet’s life in an effort to maintain weight,"" USADA said in a statement.

Due to the difficulty of administering the medication Nash came into contact with it via her hands. The bottle did not warn users about the risk of contamination from exposure to skin.

Working with lab experts USADA established that such exposure would cause a positive test, the agency said.

It therefore concluded Nash had no fault or negligence and would not be sanctioned.

If she had not been cleared, Nash, who competed as a skier at two winter Olympics before switching to cycling, faced a four-year ban.

""As in this case, we always work as hard to try to exonerate the truly innocent as we do to convict those who intentionally cheat,"" said USADA boss Travis Tygart.

USADA disclosed Nash's no-fault violation in keeping with WADA rules but Tygart said the rules needed to change.

""If there is no question that an athlete comes into contact with a prohibited substance from a completely innocent source and there is no effect on performance, USADA continues to advocate that there should not be a violation or a public announcement,” he said.

""The rules must change and all of us must wake up and demand a more fair and just global anti-doping system that catches and sanctions intentional cheats who rob clean athletes but does not railroad innocent athletes.""",[],

""I'm not a buyer of that, I'm not a supporter of that,"" he told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit.

""Why mortgage your future?,"" added the former Goldman Sachs banker. ""We can be self-sufficent ourselves.""

Serie A's key media business has drawn interest from a number of banks and investment funds and its clubs are due to meet later this month to consider their next step.

A UEFA report published last month showed the January transfer window was dominated by English clubs who spent a total of 830 million euros ($878 million) which accounted for 53 per cent of global transfer spending.

English clubs cannot sign Europe-based players under the age of 18, however, and Masters said at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London that the immigration system ""needs a bit of a tweak"".

""Whilst we're totally committed to developing young, homegrown players and we want (England manager) Gareth Southgate to be successful... when you have a limited supply of players you can go for and you've got lots of demand, then it's slightly inflationary,"" Masters said.

""That's certainly not the only reason why lots of money and records are being broken in the Premier League transfer window, but it's a contributing factor.""

The UK Home Office has a points-based Government Body Endorsement (GBE) system based on which clubs must apply to England's Football Association to sign players.

""Ultimately we have generated an earned advantage over our European investors and a lot of that earned advantage goes to those European investors in transfer fees for players that we can no longer buy at a younger age,"" Masters added.

""Some of this has nothing to do with the GBE system. It's just that if you're outside Europe, we can't buy younger players in the same way that you could before, but it's partially to do with the GBE system.""

BIGGEST SPENDERS

Chelsea were the biggest spenders having laid out more than 500 million pounds ($596 million) in two windows since an investment group led by American Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital took over the club in May last year.

Their massive outlay of nearly 300 million pounds on eight players in January - which included the 106.8 million-pound signing of Enzo Fernandez - was more than the combined totals of all clubs in the Bundesliga, LaLiga, Serie A and Ligue 1.

Their spending raised questions on how they would comply with Financial Fair Play regulations but Masters said they needed to be judged over a period of time.

""I'm not here to defend the new owners who have owned the club for less than a year and had two transfer windows,"" Masters said.

""They might have bought, but they would probably argue they have a different transfer policy to the previous regime with younger players, longer contracts and lower wages.

""Within our rules it's a test over a 12-month period, so the question is whether they are going to sell some of their existing players in the next window.""

A threatening hand-written message for 35-year-old Messi, Argentina's captain and seven-times World Player of the Year, was also left on the shop door.

""Messi, we are waiting for you, (Pablo) Javkin (the mayor) is also a narco, he is not going to take care of you,"" it read.

Javkin blamed the security forces for failing to effectively combat organized crime, which in recent years has grown in the important port city, where dozens of ships daily load thousands of tons of grain.

""I spoke (with the Roccuzzos) and they are worried,"" Javkin told reporters outside the supermarket that was attacked.

Television images showed bullet casings on the sidewalk where the business belonging to Roccuzzo's family is located. The front of the building was hit by 14 bullets and the shop remained closed on Thursday morning.

Santa Fe's Security Minister Claudio Brilloni told reporters that authorities did not have any firm assumptions regarding the motives for the attack. Prosecutor Federico Rébola said the Roccuzzo family had not received any previous threats, a Rosario media outlet reported.

On the official Twitter account ""Team Messi"" and Antonela Roccuzzo's Instagram profile there were no mentions of the incidents.

The murder rate in Rosario is among the highest in Argentina, as gangs linked to drug trafficking coexist, according to judicial complaints, and clashes causing injuries and deaths are frequently reported.

Newcastle's takeover by a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) was rubber-stamped in October 2021 after ""legally binding assurances"" that the Saudi government would have no control of the north-east club.

However, a U.S. court case concerning the PGA Tour and LIV golf this week described Newcastle chairman and PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan as a ""sitting minister of the government,"" casting doubt on the independence of the club's ownership.

""The Premier League will surely need to re-examine the assurances made about the non-involvement of the Saudi authorities in the Newcastle deal, not least as there's still a Qatari bid for Manchester United currently on the table,"" said Peter Frankental, Amnesty's UK economic affairs director.

Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani, a member of the Qatar royal family, is fronting one of the two groups who are seeking a full takeover of Manchester United.

The brief filed in the PGA Tour case against LIV Golf described the Public Investment Fund as ""a sovereign instrumentality of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.""

PIF is chaired by Saudi Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman. Six of the other eight board members are Saudi government ministers, according to PIF's website, while one is Advisor at the Royal Court and Al Rumayyan is Governor of the PIF.

""It was always stretching credulity to breaking point to imagine that the Saudi state wasn't directing the buyout of Newcastle with the ultimate aim of using the club as a component in its wider sportswashing efforts,"" Amnesty's Frankental was quoted as saying by the BBC.

""There's an unmistakable irony in the sovereign wealth fund declaration emerging in a dispute about another arm of Saudi Arabia's growing sports empire, but the simple fact is that Saudi sportswashing is affecting numerous sports and governing bodies need to respond to it far more effectively.""

LIV Golf and the PGA Tour have been in litigation since several LIV players filed federal antitrust lawsuits last August.

""I think this is the least points I've had as number one. It happens,"" Djokovic told reporters following his win over Tomas Machac in Dubai on Tuesday (Feb 28).

""It's not only due to my circumstances of not playing a couple of Grand Slams and everything that happened last year, but also other players, some players missing some slams for injuries, some not having the biggest consistency.

""I guess that makes the achievement bigger, at least in my team's and my eyes. I'm overwhelmed with pride. I work as hard as anybody else. I'm really committed to the sport. And I try.""

Djokovic is now into his 378th week as the world number one, surpassing Steffi Graf's record for the most weeks at the top of the sport.

But he said younger players like Carlos Alcaraz and Stefanos Tsitsipas will eventually catch up with him.

""These guys are playing at a high level constantly. They're playing a lot of tournaments. I'm not playing as much and don't plan to play as many weeks as they do,"" Djokovic said.

""Eventually they'll take the number one, then I'll bring it back again, then they'll take it again. We'll go in circles.""",[],

Djokovic, who surpassed Steffi Graf's record for the most weeks as world number one after starting his 378th at the top of the rankings, moved with ease and showed no lingering effects of the hamstring tear he managed at Melbourne Park last month.

But there were some signs of rust especially on Djokovic's serve, which seemed to fail him midway through the opening set, before he regained control and took the early advantage in the match when Machac sent a return long.

The five-times Dubai champion was in a spot of bother while trailing 3-0 in the next set after dropping serve again and made 16 unforced errors to allow big-hitting Machac to take the contest into a decider.

Machac began to struggle with a right wrist issue early in the third set and Djokovic pounced for a 3-1 lead but the Czech mounted a comeback with a break of his own to level at 4-4 with some superb ball-striking along the way.

Machac blinked first in the tiebreak and Djokovic did not need another invitation as he finally quelled the world number 130 to extend his 2023 winning streak to 13 matches.

""Tomas didn't play like a world number 130. He played great tennis and deserves all the applause. He was giving me all kinds of trouble but when it mattered most I found another gear,"" Djokovic said.

""Physically I can be better. I demand the highest standards in quality of tennis and preparation. I have struggled with an injury and needed some time. But I'm hoping as the tournament progresses that I can raise the level of tennis as well.""

Djokovic next plays Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands.

The world number two, who was scheduled to play his opening match later on Tuesday, picked up the injury during his loss to Cameron Norrie in Sunday's Rio Open final where the pain hindered both his movement and serve.

""I have a grade 1 strain in my right hamstring that will keep me out for several days, according to the tests we did this morning,"" Alcaraz wrote on Twitter.

""I'm really sad I can't compete here, but now it's time to think about recovering and being ready as soon as possible. I hope to see you all soon!""

After spending more than three months out of action due to abdominal and hamstring injuries, Alcaraz returned to the ATP Tour in February at Buenos Aires where he beat Norrie in the final for his first title since last year's U.S. Open.

At the Rio Open, the 19-year-old Spaniard needed treatment for a left leg problem during his semi-final and then picked up an injury to the other leg in the match against Norrie during which he needed his leg wrapped midway through the final.

Norrie also pulled out of the tournament in Mexico saying he needed to rest.

The Briton, who leads the ATP Tour in match victories this season with 18, is scheduled to return to action at the Indian Wells hardcourt event beginning next week.

The 22-times Grand Slam champion, who has not competed since his Australian Open title defence ended in a second-round loss during which he aggravated a hip problem, said he had started rehab and physiotherapy as instructed by doctors.

""I am sad that I won't be able to compete at Indian Wells nor Miami. Very sad not to be there,"" read a message posted on Nadal's Twitter account. ""I'll miss all my US fans but I hope to see them later this year during the summer swing.""

Nadal lost in straight sets to Taylor Fritz in last year's Indian Wells final and then skipped the Miami Open so that he could focus on his claycourt preparation.

The 36-year-old Spaniard is a three-times champion at Indian Wells having triumphed in 2007, 2009 and 2013. Nadal has reached the Miami final five times but has never won the title and has not competed there since 2017.

""We wish Rafa continued healing, and hope to see him back at the BNP Paribas Open next year,"" Indian Wells tournament director Tommy Haas said in a statement.

At the Australian Open, top seed Nadal tweaked his left hip while running for a backhand in the second set at Rod Laver Arena, and after inspection from a trainer when trailing 6-4 5-3, he went off-court for a medical time-out.

Foden struck in the seventh minute but it was not an entirely comfortable night for Pep Guardiola's side until the England forward's deflected effort made it 2-0 late on.

Kevin De Bruyne then gave the scoreline an emphatic look with a sublime finish from 25 metres although it was harsh on Bristol City who had been on a 12-match unbeaten run and pushed the Premier League champions hard.

Leicester were booed off after a 2-1 home defeat by second-tier Blackburn Rovers for whom Tyrhys Dolan and Sammie Szmodics were on target before a Kelechi Iheanacho reply.

Fulham reached the sixth round for the first time in 13 years with superb goals by Joao Palhinha and Manor Solomon earning them a 2-0 win over fellow top-flight side Leeds United.

Brighton and Hove Albion's hopes of a first ever major trophy remained intact as Evan Ferguson's first-half goal sealed a 1-0 win over second-tier Stoke City.

Guardiola named a strong side, as he invariably does in domestic cup competitions, and City began the game in dynamic style with Kalvin Phillips hitting the crossbar.

City did not have to wait long to take the lead though with Foden firing high into the roof of the net from Riyad Mahrez's pass across the face of goal.

The hosts did not buckle though and had a good shout for a penalty declined when Mark Sykes went down under a challenge from Rico Lewis in the area while Alex Scott forced a decent save from City keeper Stefan Ortega.

Bristol City, who were spared having to deal with rested Erling Haaland, were still very much in the game until De Bruyne split their defence with a ball to Nathan Ake whose pass eventually fell to Foden whose shot deflected into the net off of Zak Vyner.

""It was really tough. Bristol showed us how good they can be. I was impressed by some players, I didn't know them. The second half was much better,"" Guardiola said.

Promotion-chasing Blackburn thoroughly deserved their win at Leicester whose form remains wildly unpredictable.

""It's just consistency and mentality and ambition to succeed. That's been too up and down for us,"" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said.

""I'm really disappointed for the supporters. It's been a real challenge for them this season. The FA Cup was an opportunity to get to a quarter-final, against a Championship team at home, but they were a lot better than us, and we have to be worried about that.""

Fulham's magnificent season continues under Marco Silva with the Cottagers still chasing a European qualification spot on two fronts. They were not at their best against Leeds who had a host of chances and a goal disallowed but still showed their quality.

Palhinha struck a superb curled effort after winning the ball after 21 minutes and Israeli Solomon's 56th-minute goal was almost as impressive.

""It is great for us to go to the quarter-final,"" Silva, whose side are sixth in the Premier League, said.

""We know our story with the FA Cup is not great and we are here to try and change it.""

Liverpool are seventh in the standings, nine points adrift of Tottenham Hotspur in fourth place, but Klopp's side have two games in hand, with arch rivals Manchester United visiting Anfield on Sunday.

Liverpool played Wolves twice in the FA Cup, winning the replay 1-0 before losing 3-0 in the reverse league fixture earlier this month and Klopp said he hoped to learn from their mistakes in that defeat.

""Nothing I saw in training suggests we don't have a chance. We know a lot about each other and we know it won't be easy. There won't be the most surprising information and we have to make sure we are ready,"" Klopp told reporters.

""It is a super important week, we cannot ignore that. We have two home games ... I would love to give the season a little push in this week and we need results for that. And for results we need good performances.

""The main difference is we will play at Anfield and we have to make that count. It's a long period between games, we want to put it right. But I am more focussed on giving the season a proper push, we need to find a steady mood.""

Liverpool still have several injuries, however, with influential midfielder Thiago Alcantara still sidelined with a hip problem while defender Joe Gomez is also ruled out with a muscle injury.

The club did receive a boost with Luis Diaz back in training after a knee injury but Klopp said the Colombian forward has not trained with the team yet.

Uruguayan striker Darwin Nunez is a doubt with a shoulder injury but Klopp said it was 'massive' to have former Wolves winger Diogo Jota back after the Portugal international returned from a calf injury that had ruled him out of the World Cup.

""Diogo is an exceptional player. He needs to get rhythm now,"" Klopp said.

""He was tired after the game on Saturday (a 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace) and we have to see. He will definitely be involved again ... He's a top class player, versatile, helpful for this busy period.""",[],

Paul Scriven, a member of Britain's House of Lords, told a news conference organised by the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) that the sport was at a fork in the road.

""There are two roads that F1 can now take. One is a road which is a moral vacuum where the leaders and the administrators seem to going,"" he said.

""There is another road that some drivers seem to be taking ... who understand they can use their platform and their sport not just for sport's sake but for good and for change and that they cannot ignore the human rights abuses in the country that they are driving in.""

Mercedes driver Hamilton, a seven-times world champion, has used his profile to address rights abuses and racial injustice around the world.

The sport's governing body updated the sporting code last December requiring drivers to get prior written permission to make or display ""political, religious and personal statements or comments"".

Hamilton, who said in 2021 that Formula One cannot ignore issues in the countries it visits, has vowed to continue speaking out and other drivers have said the same.

Bahrain hosts the opening race on Sunday, with the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on Mar 19.

BIRD said human rights in the two countries had been ""increasingly trampled on"" since last year's grands prix and accused Formula One of helping to ""facilitate sportswashing of abuses.""

It called for an independent enquiry to examine the role of races in human rights violations.

The accusation of 'sportswashing' is levelled at countries who are perceived to be using sport to improve a tarnished image abroad.

BIRD said it had written to Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali urging him to meet victims and use ""all available leverage"" to seek the release of jailed activists.

A statement was read out on behalf of families of 12 prisoners BIRD said were facing death sentences in Bahrain.

The Sunni-ruled state, a US ally, crushed an anti-government uprising led largely by the Shi'ite Muslim community in 2011.

Bahrain's government has said it ""actively supports the role Formula One can play in shedding light on human rights issues in all countries it operates in"".

Scriven said Formula One drivers would be justified in refusing to race in certain countries if the sport failed to put in place a proper ethical framework.

Formula One said it sought to be a positive force everywhere it raced and had made its position on human rights and other issues clear to all partners and hosts.

A spokesman for the FIA, which does not draw up the calendar, said it could not interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state but was not insensitive ""to any potential hardships endured by the people concerned"".",[],
69,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/former-france-great-fontaine-has-died-report-3315191,World Cup finals record goal-scorer Just Fontaine dies,"PARIS: Just Fontaine, the all-time top scorer in a single World Cup finals with 13 goals, has died aged 89, his family told AFP on Wednesday (Mar 1).

Fontaine achieved the record during the 1958 finals in Sweden, where France reached the semi-finals for the first time in their history.

To this day, only three players have scored more World Cup goals than Fontaine, even though the Reims player appeared at just one tournament and played only six matches.

Lionel Messi matched his tally on Argentina's recent run to glory in Qatar, but it took him five World Cups to get there.

That 1958 World Cup in Sweden is best remembered as the coming of age of a 17-year-old Pele, who inspired Brazil to victory after netting a hat-trick in their 5-2 semi-final win over France.

However, it was a personal triumph for Fontaine, whose four-goal haul in the third-place playoff win over West Germany ensured that he had scored in every game.

Part of a wonderful attacking trident alongside Roger Piantoni and Raymond Kopa, Fontaine might never have gone to Sweden at all.

Only injuries to Thadee Cisowski and his Reims teammate Rene Bliard saw him make the squad and then the starting line-up.

""It was only at the airport before leaving for Sweden that Paul Nicolas (part of the national team staff) and Albert Batteux (the France coach), who didn't really want me, told me I would be playing as centre-forward,"" Fontaine told AFP in 2013.

Only Germany's Miroslav Klose (16), Brazil's Ronaldo (15) and Gerd Muller, the West German hero of the 1970s who scored 14 times, have netted more World Cup finals goals.

Just two other players - Muller with 10 in 1970 and Hungary's Sandor Kocsis with 11 in 1954 - have reached double figures at a single World Cup.

Yet, Kopa is remembered as the biggest French star of the era. When he died in 2017, Fontaine remembered fondly his ""big brother"".

""Raymond had character,"" he said. ""So did I, and that made us a magical duo.""

Born in Marrakech in August 1933 to a French father and Spanish mother at the time of the French Protectorate in Morocco, Fontaine went to school in Casablanca, and began his football career there.",[],

They saw no need to tinker after New Zealand pulled off an incredible one-run win in the second test in Wellington on Tuesday after being asked to follow on by England captain Ben Stokes, coach Gary Stead said.

Opener Devon Conway was nursing a groin strain at the Basin Reserve and paceman Matt Henry had tightness in his back, but both were expected to be fit and available for Christchurch.

Faith in the playing group has been restored quickly, with Stead admitting after the 267-run defeat in the first test in Mount Maunganui that New Zealand were down on confidence.

""We felt that the 13 that we have here is the right 13 to go forward,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. ""I think when you have a win like that (in Wellington), whether you win or lose, your confidence will improve.""

Having won the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC) in 2021, New Zealand's title defence is already over, but the Sri Lanka series has ramifications for this year's championship.

Sri Lanka could sneak into the WTC final if they whitewash New Zealand and if Australia are swept by India in the ongoing four-test series.

India, leading the home series 2-0, need only one more victory to secure their place in the final.

New Zealand will look to regroup for the next WTC but Wellington shed much of the gloom that has engulfed the side since a slew of seasoned players retired or opted out of test cricket last year.

Kane Williamson scored a century in a welcome return to form while wicketkeeper Tom Blundell had a terrific test with the bat and behind the stumps.

New Zealand's main concerns lie in their bowling, with quality quicks thin on the ground after Trent Boult's decision to opt out of his national contract and Kyle Jamieson's continuing back problems.

The Black Caps have also been unable to unearth a high-quality all-rounder to replace Colin de Grandhomme and provide support for pacemen Tim Southee, Henry and Neil Wagner.

All-rounder Michael Bracewell laboured in that role in Wellington where his deficiencies as a part-time spinner were exposed and his batting contributed only 46 runs in four innings.

Those concerns were set aside on Wednesday as the team soaked up acclaim in the nation's media for pulling off the 'Miracle at the Basin' and protecting their unbeaten record in home test series dating back to 2017.

""I think we’ve had (character) in the team all the time I’ve been there,"" Stead said. ""And probably before that as well. When you look back over the last 10 years or so we’ve been a team that have punched above our weight and I think yesterday was a great example of that.""",[],

Benn, 26, also criticised the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) for lacking consideration for his mental state and reiterated his innocence in a statement on social media on Tuesday.

The WBC ruled on Feb. 22 Benn's ""highly elevated consumption of eggs"" was a reasonable explanation for failed tests last year. It found no procedural failures and no conclusive evidence that Benn had intentionally ingested the banned substance Clomiphene.

Positive findings for ""trace amounts of a fertility drug"" in a random test carried out by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) led to Benn's fight with compatriot Chris Eubank Jr being called off in October.

""In my defence to the WBC and the 270-page report provided to them, at no point did I indicate that I failed any VADA tests because of contaminated eggs,"" Benn said. ""I feel like the WBC statement did a disservice to my defence.

""As part of its lengthy investigation, the WBC instructed its own experts to review my supplements and diet, and they concluded that egg contamination was the most likely cause.

""My sample appears to have come back clear the first three times it was tested. Without explanation it was retested again after nine days and only then did it show a trace positive result.""

Benn, whose father Nigel was a super-middleweight world champion, relinquished his licence with the BBBofC after his fight with Eubank Jr was called off. He remains under investigation by UKAD, Britain's anti-doping body.

The BBBofC said last Wednesday it was not part of the WBC's review.

""I have never previously failed any kind of anti-doping test, and passed multiple tests with both UKAD and VADA in close proximity to the two tests that returned adverse findings,"" Benn added.

""This adds further proof to my belief that the findings were testing errors.

""As for the BBBofC, they attacked me publicly and privately during the most difficult time in my life, treating me with utter contempt and without any consideration for fair process or my mental state.""

On a track where the ball spun viciously from the first session, Matt Kuhnemann (5-16) and Nathan Lyon (3-35) engineered India's spectacular collapse in 33.2 overs.

Usman Khawaja then showed how to master those conditions as he made 60 and raised 96 runs for the second wicket with Marnus Labuschagne to put Australia ahead.

The visitors, who are 2-0 behind in the four-test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, finished the frenetic opening day 47 runs ahead with six wickets in hand.

Peter Handcomb was batting on seven at the close with Cameron Green on six at the other end.

""I just started playing with my plans and trying to score when I saw a scoring opportunity and respected the good ball when it was there,"" Khawaja said of his batting approach.

""It's not rocket science to be honest. It was nice to get out there and get a partnership with Marnus.""

Beaten inside three days both in Nagpur and Delhi, Australia persisted with a three-pronged spin attack but had to make a couple of changes to their battered squad.

Stand-in skipper Steve Smith introduced spin after five overs of pace bowling by Mitchell Starc and Green, both of whom returned from finger injuries to play their first match of the series.

Regular skipper Pat Cummins is back home to be with his ailing mother, while opener David Warner has returned having fractured his elbow in Delhi.

India captain Rohit Sharma was left to rue his decision to bat first and he himself could have been dismissed twice in the first over from Starc, but Australia did not challenge those on-field decisions.

It did not really matter though once the spinners took over.

Kuhnemann removed Rohit (12) stumped and, in his next over, cut short Shubman Gill's (21) promising knock to unhinge India.

Lyon then joined the party, dismissing Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja in his successive overs and India slumped to 45-5 after a frenetic opening hour.

Virat Kohli (22) gamely hung on for a while but once Todd Murphy trapped him lbw, wickets started tumbling and India eventually wilted half an hour into the second session.

After the innings break, India predictably began with spin from both ends and Travis Head (nine) fell lbw to Ravindra Jadeja (4-63) in the second over of the innings.

Labuschagne, who made 31, combined with Khawaja to steady the innings and had luck on his side too.

The batsman was yet to open his account when he dragged the ball onto his stumps but bowler Jadeja was found to have over-stepped.

This was the third time in the series that Jadeja's penchant to bowl no-balls cost him a wicket.

Labuschagne got another reprieve later when India opted against reviewing an lbw decision against him and replays subsequently confirmed the batter would have been dismissed had they done so.

Jadeja eventually removed Labuschagne just before Australia drew level and went on to pick the crucial wickets of Khawaja and Smith (26).",[],

While Stokes had no regrets about enforcing the follow-on in the one-run defeat in Wellington, he had plenty about the state of his left knee which had him grimacing in pain throughout the drawn two-test series.

Knee trouble has long bothered Stokes but he has soldiered on through 10 test wins in 12 matches since taking charge of England last year.

Things appeared to have come to a head in Wellington, though, where the all-rounder managed to bowl only two overs and was in all sorts of bother when batting despite making 60 runs.

A reliable wicket-taker who often makes things happen with the ball, Stokes' seam bowling was not needed in the first innings as New Zealand were bundled out for 209.

However, England's bowlers might have yearned for their captain's support after he enforced the follow-on and put them in the field again.

New Zealand went on to rack up 483 against them as they tired and set a chase that England fell just short of.

Rather than rest up for the three-and-a-half months before the Ashes, Stokes will be heading to the Indian Premier League (IPL) starting March 31 to fulfil his $2 million deal with the Chennai Super Kings.

Former England captain Michael Vaughan called on Stokes to forgo the IPL to boost his chances of being fully fit for the Ashes which start in Birmingham on June 16.

Stokes wasn't having it.

""I've been working hard with the physios and the medics out here to try to get myself into a place where I can fill that (bowling) role like how I have done the last 10 years or however long it is,"" he said in Wellington.

""I've got a four-month period now to get it, sort of, even better before that Ashes because I want to be turning up in Birmingham being able to fill that role properly.""

England's attacking 'Bazball' revolution under Stokes and head coach Brendon 'Baz' McCullum has breathed new life into test cricket and raised hopes of a classic Ashes contest after Australia dominated the last series 4-0 at home in 2021-22.

Stokes's ability to get through five tests, let alone bowl in them, will be under the microscope.

There are no such doubts, however, about England's commitment to its attacking game and employing it during the Ashes - despite the Wellington setback.

Foster had urged NZR to wait until after the World Cup to decide, however the governing body said ""recent events"" and competition for talent in the global rugby market had forced their hand.

""Following wide ranging consultation and after carefully weighing up all scenarios and the key lessons from 2019, New Zealand Rugby is now commencing a process for selecting the All Blacks Head Coach from 2024,"" NZR Chairwoman Patsy Reddy said in a statement.

""Noting the divergent views as to the best timings for this process and that neither timing window is perfect, out of respect for the people involved, New Zealand Rugby will not be making any further comment after today until a decision has been reached.

""This will be concluded in the next four to six weeks.""

The statement comes three weeks after Scott Robertson, tipped to succeed Foster after the World Cup, said he was expecting an imminent announcement about his future in the New Zealand coaching structure.

Robertson lost out to Foster for the role when Steve Hansen stood down in 2019 but the success he has overseen at the Canterbury Crusaders has earned him plenty of coaching offers in other countries.

Reddy said Foster and the current All Blacks staff continued to have NZR's ""full support"" up to and through the World Cup.

Foster told New Zealand media last week that he might like to continue in the role if the All Blacks won the global showpiece.

On Wednesday, he said he would accept NZR's decision and move on.

""As I said last week, I felt the best thing for our team and for our entire management group was to have this process done after the Rugby World Cup,"" he said in a statement.

""My sole focus remains unchanged. It is to lead this All Blacks team and management group in our planning and preparation so that we go to France with the goal of winning the Rugby World Cup and making this country proud.

""I won't be re-applying for the job.""

Foster was under intense scrutiny last year when the All Blacks suffered three consecutive defeats against Ireland and South Africa but NZR endorsed him as coach through to the World Cup following a review in August.

He subsequently guided the All Blacks to an eighth Rugby Championship title and an undefeated tour of the northern hemisphere at the end of last season.",[],

With fewer marquee names to boast in its field, the PGA Tour's Honda Classic brought in 1.61 million viewers Saturday and 2.38 million on Sunday, by comparison, on NBC.

LIV Golf did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

LIV Golf is the first sport to broadcast on the CW Network, after the two parties agreed a multi-year deal in January.

Perry Sook, the chairman and CEO of CW Network parent company Nexstar, said on Tuesday's earnings call that the three-day tournament was viewed by more than 1.4 million across the network and its digital platform.

""We're very pleased with our first weekend of LIV Golf,"" said Sook.

""It's selling very well and I think we'll continue to grow as we get more into the season and more involved.""

Noel Le Graet, president of France's soccer federation (FFF), resigned on Tuesday, while Canada Soccer boss Nick Bontis stepped down a day earlier with those countries' players embroiled in bitter disputes with their federations.

Canada's women's team have vowed to boycott a pre-World Cup camp next month over equal pay and support, while Le Graet faced allegations of harassment. A government ministry audit concluded the 81-year-old Le Graet did not have the ""necessary legitimacy"" for the position.

French women's coach Corinne Diacre is also under fire and her future may be decided on March 9 by an FFF select committee.

Spain has also been rocked by a revolt by 15 players, who withdrew from selection consideration in protest at coach Jorge Vilda.

While the clashes could cast a cloud over the women's global showcase, which begins on July 20th in New Zealand and Australia, players have vowed their fights are far from over, and some say the recent resignations should be just the tip of widespread changes.

""Bontis' departure MUST trigger sweeping change,"" Amy Walsh, who played for Canada at the 2008 Olympics and earned 102 caps, posted on Twitter. ""It's not enough.

""Our athletes - as well as future generations of Canadian footballers - deserve so much better.""

Neither Bontis nor Le Graet, however, are leaving the game. Bontis was named CONCACAF Council vice-president (North America) on Saturday, while Le Graet, who has denied all accusations, has reportedly been pegged to lead FIFA's Paris office.

SUCCESS ON THE PITCH

The turmoil in the two women's programmes is in stark contrast to their success on the pitch. Canada are the reigning Olympic women's champions, while France topped their group in World Cup qualifying.

And while the governance battles rage on, female footballers have forged strong bonds - regardless of what country's colours they wear. When the Canadian women played the recent SheBelieves Cup under protest, they found they had allies in players from around the world.

Both the Americans, who settled an equal pay lawsuit with their federation for $24 million a year ago, and Japanese wore purple tape on their wrists at the SheBelieves Cup, while the U.S. women said in a statement: ""Although we are now on the other side of this fight... our counterparts in Canada and elsewhere are experiencing the same pervasive misogyny and unequal treatment that we faced.""

Across the pond, England's Lionesses wore purple wristbands at the Arnold Clark Cup, to ""display their support (for) the Canadian WNT players and for gender equality,"" the team said in a tweet.

Canada's call for equality goes beyond equal pay. Forward Janine Beckie, who was in Qatar for last year's men's World Cup as part of Canada's broadcast crew, saw the ""disgusting"" discrepancy between the two programmes.

She cited as an example that the Canadian men's team staff was twice the size of the women's.

""I think we've been fighting blindly not knowing what our federation was capable of in terms of support, and then we were all witnesses to what our men's team received,"" said longtime captain Christine Sinclair.

Canadian midfielder Sophie Schmidt told media through tears in Orlando that she nearly quit over shoddy treatment from their federation, but Sinclair and coach Bev Priestman convinced her to reconsider.

France's team captain Wendie Renard said last week she would not play at the World Cup as long as Diacre is in charge.

Fellow French internationals Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Kadidiatou Diani have also said they were taking a step back from the national team.

Spain's 15 players declared themselves unavailable, saying in a statement that playing ""significantly"" affected their ""emotional state.""

The federation replied saying that it wouldn't tolerate any pressure from players.

The only time Pogba has been part of the squad this season was as an unused substitute in the 2-0 loss against Monza on Jan. 29.

""Pogba will be called up for the derby and will play if necessary. He doesn't have much playing time in his legs, but more than enough,"" Allegri told reporters.

""I have spoken to him as I have done with the other players. He must understand that we're at an important stage of the season. He must have the drive to have given his contribution at the end of the season.""

Allegri added that forward Federico Chiesa, who has been on and off with injuries this season, is also back in regular training after missing recent games.

""Yesterday, Chiesa trained with the team after six so-so days. Now to say that Pogba can be a starter after 315 days on the sidelines or likewise, Chiesa, who has been out for 10 months, is another thing. A little patience is needed,"" Allegri said.

""(Leonardo) Bonucci is fine, but due to his long period of inactivity, he'll be sitting close to me at kick-off tomorrow evening. But having him back is already an important plus, he is the club captain after all.""

Allegri's side are eighth in the standings on 32 points, one above city rivals Torino ahead of the home clash, and will aim to expand their winning streak to four league matches.

Juve were deducted 15 points for the current season by an Italian soccer court investigating the club's transfer dealings in January. Still, Allegri said that the season's main goal has not changed.

France forward Mbappe, who was on the losing side against Messi's Argentina in the World Cup final, became PSG's joint record scorer with 200 goals - level with Edinson Cavani - while Messi netted his 700th in club football.

""We were aggressive, we put intensity into the game, that's what we'd been missing,"" said PSG centre back Sergio Ramos.

PSG, who were knocked out of the French Cup in the last 16 by Marseille earlier this month, ended a three-game losing streak in all competitions by beating Lille last weekend and they were focused throughout at the Velodrome.

They suffered an early injury blow when Presnel Kimpembe, who missed the World Cup for France with an Achilles issue, left the pitch on a stretcher, two weeks after making his comeback from a three-month layoff.

Matteo Guendouzi created danger as Marseille pressed high and hard but they were exposed on the counter and the hosts were punished in the 25th minute when Messi played Mbappe through for the France forward to race into the area and beat Pau Lopez with a low shot.

The roles were reversed four minutes later as Mbappe delivered a pin-point cross for Messi, who tapped in from point-blank range to double the advantage in front of an all-time Ligue 1 record attendance of 65,800.

Messi then missed a sitter and Mbappe was denied by Lopez after being found in the area by the Argentine again, just before Marquinhos's angled shot went just wide as Marseille were again caught on the break.

Messi beautifully lifted the ball into the path of Mbappe, who volleyed home with his left foot for his 16th goal of the season in Ligue 1.

England's man of the moment Harry Brook came to the middle but was run out without facing a ball as Root made a shocking call for a single after pushing a Southee ball to the gully.

Bracewell swooped from the slips and threw to the stumps where wicketkeeper Tom Blundell whipped off the bails with Brook well short of his ground.

New Zealand introduced spin before the drinks break, with Bracewell coming into the attack but the tactic backfired as Root clobbered a six and two fours in successive balls in the all-rounder's first over.

Stokes was lucky at one stage, with Henry finding the shoulder of his bat, but the ball pinged harmlessly off Blundell's gloves.

""I honestly feel like I'm going to cry. I've never been so happy in my life,"" a jubilant Brooks said.

Brooks, who only participated in three World Cup events before the world championships, was too young to compete at the Beijing Olympics last year.

After taking off backwards, Brookes completed four 360 degree aerial rotations while grabbing the board twice before landing as she pulled off the Cab 1440 double grab.

""I had tried it once before in practice and I knew I had to do it if I wanted to win. But then I got really worried because if I landed it, I would just want to jump up and start crying because I'd be so happy,"" Brooks added.

Bristol City, who are managed by Nigel Pearson, have been unbeaten in all competitions since the last week of December, moving up to 13th in the second-tier Championship.

The last time the two teams faced each other at Ashton Gate, Manchester City edged Bristol City 3-2 in the League Cup semi-finals second leg in 2018 en route to Guardiola's first trophy with the English club.

""From my experience in this country, in the last six years, when you go (play) away in the FA cup at a Championship team, it is always, always tough. (Playing at) home is a little different,"" Guardiola told reporters ahead of Tuesday's clash.

""Last 12 games - no defeat. That means they are there. My scouts are saying it's a good team. The manager has experience, did really well with Leicester (City) and Watford when he was there one or two seasons ago.

""It's a final. The FA cup is a really, really important competition, so it's a serious team we will play tomorrow.""

Manchester City bounced back from two consecutive draws to beat Bournemouth 4-1 over the weekend but Guardiola feels the team can play better as they sit two points behind league leaders Arsenal, who have a game in hand.

""The way we are playing is good, results could be better. Sometimes it happens in football,"" Guardiola said.

""I have no complaints about how we are playing and how we are fighting. The mood in the locker room is exceptional and the guys are doing everything - that is enough for me.

""It won’t be easy, South Africa are a tough team at home, but we are looking forward to playing some hard days of test cricket,"" Brathwaite told reporters on Monday.

""It is important we take control of every hour, and not look at the big picture, just go from session to session.""

West Indies have lost 12 of their previous 15 tests in South Africa and won just one, though this is the first time they have toured the country in the longest format since 2015. Their only victory was a surprise success in Gqeberha 16 years ago.

Brathwaite, who opens the batting, concedes it will be a big step up from what they faced in Zimbabwe and it will be up to the batters to lay the platform for success against the home side's vaunted pace attack on helpful wickets.

Just as they had in Germany three weeks ago when Dortmund won 1-0, 2021 champions Chelsea squandered chance after chance in the first half, with Germany's Havertz hitting the post as well as the side netting.

Portugal loanee Joao Felix and defender Kalidou Koulibaly also went close and Sterling had efforts blocked.

But in the 43rd minute Ben Chilwell crossed into the box and found England team mate Sterling.

Sterling airkicked his first effort, then sidestepped Marco Reus and sent his second high into the net to put the teams level on aggregate.

""It was a massive performance,"" Sterling told BT Sport. ""We had to dig deep. We took our chances. We felt as a team we could do it.""I had a little mis-kick with the first touch but it landed perfectly and allowed us to build on that for our performance.""

Early in the second half a Chilwell cross smacked into the outstretched hand of defender Marius Wolf and Dutch referee Danny Makkelie gave the penalty after being called to the VAR screen.Havertz, taking over as penalty taker from Jorginho who moved to Arsenal in January, hit the keeper's left-hand post to the relief of the visitors.

The game resumed for a few seconds until VAR alerted Makkelie that Dortmund players had encroached into the area.

Havertz retook the kick and sent the ball the same way but this time it squeezed inside the post to put Chelsea ahead in the tie in the 53rd minute.

""I don't know what I was thinking (when it hit the post) but the referee let me retake the penalty,"" Havertz said. ""I was a bit nervous but I scored. I tried to wait and look at the keeper and the second one was a bit easier.""

It was Dortmund's first defeat following wins in their previous 10 matches and a boost for Chelsea, who have struggled for form under Graham Potter since the turn of the year, dropping to 10th place in the Premier League and losing early in their two domestic cups.

A smiling Potter punched the air and applauded the crowd as his team acknowledged the cheers.

""There was a fantastic feeling in the dressing room,"" he said. ""We have been through a tough period and this competition means a lot for us. We wanted to progress and get into the last eight and it sets us up for the next few weeks.""

He said he had confidence in Havertz to score but was too nervous to watch.

Led by a tireless Joao Mario, who netted a late penalty, and the in-form Ramos, Benfica showed exactly why they are seen in Portugal as the country's best side since Jose Mourinho's Porto were crowned European champions 19 years ago.

""We have one objective and it's winning every game we play going forward,"" Rafa Silva, who had opened the scoring late in the first half, told Eleven Sports.

Benfica took control from the start as they pressured their rivals in the heavy rain that poured down in Lisbon.

Joao Mario had goal ruled out by VAR in the first minute for an offside in the build-up and Benfica then wasted several clear chances as the visitors looked well out of their depth.

Struggling in the Belgian league, Brugge were coming off an embarrassing 3-0 loss to lowly Oostende at the weekend and are currently languishing fourth in the standings, having now won only two of their last 15 matches in all competitions.

They were outclassed by a well organised Benfica side who remain unbeaten in this season's Champions League and have lost only two competitive games this term, both to Braga and one of those on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the Portuguese Cup.

They are on a seven-game winning streak in the Primeira Liga in which they have scoring 18 goals and conceded one.

It was only a matter of time until they took the lead against Brugge with the goal coming in the 38th minute through Rafa Silva, who dribbled past two defenders and fired a left foot strike into the net after a counter-attack.

Ramos then scored either side of the break, the first coming after a brilliant individual effort in which he dribbled past three players inside the box before slotting the ball home.

In the 57th minute, he extended the lead with a first-time shot from Alex Grimaldo's clever low cross.

Joao Mario scored the fourth from the spot in the 71st after a foul by Abakar Sylla and seven minutes later found substitute David Neres who netted the fifth before Bjorn Meijer struck a brilliant consolation goal for Brugge three minutes from time.

""Things are going well because the team is working hard,"" added Rafa Silva, whose side are top of the Primeira Liga.

The final was delayed by 36 minutes after thousands of Liverpool supporters were unable to get into the Stade de France for the match on May 28, which Real Madrid won 1-0.

French police were filmed using tear gas on fans, including women and children. Although UEFA initially blamed the Merseyside club's fans for the mayhem, the governing body later apologised following the release of an independent review.

""We have taken into account a huge number of views expressed both publicly and privately and we believe we have devised a scheme that is comprehensive and fair,"" UEFA General Secretary Theodore Theodoridis said in statement.

""We value the input from the Liverpool FC supporter organisations Spirit of Shankly (SOS) and Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association (LDSA) as well as the open and transparent dialogue throughout this period.

""We recognise the negative experiences of those supporters on the day and with this scheme we will refund fans who had bought tickets and who were the most affected by the difficulties in accessing the stadium.""

UEFA said refunds would be available to all fans with tickets for gates A, B, C, X, Y and Z which was where ""the most difficult circumstances were reported"". Liverpool fans had 19,618 tickets allocated for the final.

The two fan groups, SOS and LDSA, welcomed the announcement with a joint statement but said it does not let UEFA off the hook.

""With a promise to reimburse supporters, UEFA have gone some way to acknowledge their part in the fiasco,"" they said.

""But it does not excuse UEFA, exempt them from criticism or lessen the need for them to implement all of the recommendations made by the independent inquiry.""

Charles Leclerc, who led a Ferrari one-two from pole at Sakhir last year, lost power and retired 17 laps from the end while Carlos Sainz finished fourth.

Ferrari had already changed the energy store on Leclerc's car before the race, a blow with drivers having only two for the 23-race season without a grid penalty.

Until then both drivers had been more focused on whether their car could match the speed of Red Bull, who suffered a double retirement last year but this time cruised to a one-two finish with Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez.

""Overall I would say the picture is not the one expected before the race,"" Vasseur told reporters.

""It's the first time we had it (the problem) and we didn't face the same issue at all during the 6,000-7,000km that we did with the engines in the last week with the three teams.

""We never had the same issue on the dyno throughout the winter,"" he added.

""The most important now is to have a clear picture of the situation, where we are failing and do a proper analysis on this and to come back stronger as soon as possible.""

The Frenchman felt Ferrari were matching Red Bull in qualifying but needed to fix reliability and tyre degradation in the race.

Both Ferrari drivers suffered heavy tyre wear and while Leclerc was third before the failure, Sainz finished 48 seconds behind Verstappen.

Red Bull dominated on a soft/soft/hard tyre strategy while Ferrari had to go for soft/hard/hard.

""The fact they are able to do two soft and one hard (stints) when we have to do two hard one soft for sure is a game killer,"" said Vasseur.

""We have to improve on this but I would say that the first issue for me is the reliability because we need to have zero issues.""

Vasseur was confident Ferrari were on the right track and could be a match for Red Bull, even if rivals Mercedes are already rethinking their car's design given the gap they face.

""I never saw a car able to match the pace of another one in quali and to not be able to in the race,"" said Vasseur. ""Then it's a matter of set-up and some choices on the car. It's not a matter of concept at all.""

Ferrari won two of the first three races last year before fading due to poor reliability, strategy blunders and driver mistakes.

Vasseur arrived from Swiss-based Sauber in January to replace the departed Mattia Binotto and has made some immediate changes, including a strategy shake-up.

The Italian said he wanted to return early after Spurs were knocked out of the FA Cup by Sheffield United last week but he respected the wishes of worried doctors who had put their foot down and asked him to return only on Sunday.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Relevent Sports LLC, a sports promoter controlled by billionaire Miami Dolphins American football team owner Stephen Ross, plausibly alleged that the October 2018 ban unlawfully restricted competition.

""Adoption of the policy, combined with the member leagues' prior agreement, by joining FIFA, to adhere to its policies, constitutes an agreement on the part of all-whether they voted in favor of the policy or not-to adhere to the announced restriction on competition,"" Circuit Judge Raymond Lohier wrote.

The 3-0 decision raises the prospect that U.S. stadiums could eventually host regular season matches between foreign teams, which could compete for fans and sponsors now supporting FIFA-affiliated Major League Soccer.

Some European and South American teams play ""friendly"" matches in the United States, but not regular season matches.

FIFA, soccer's world governing body with 211 member associations, announced its foreign match policy after Relevent arranged with Spain's La Liga to host a regular season match between FC Barcelona and Girona FC in Miami.

Barcelona eventually withdrew, and Relevent sued after U.S. Soccer refused to sanction a May 2019 match in Miami between two Ecuadorean teams.

Relevent, based in New York, also operates the International Champions Cup.

In July 2021, U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni found no proof of an illegal conspiracy to ban foreign matches.

She also said U.S. Soccer had good reasons to honor the ban, including the risk FIFA might exclude U.S. men from the World Cup.

Tuesday's decision overturned that ruling, and returned the case to Caproni.

FIFA said it will review the decision. U.S. Soccer and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In an email, Relevent's lawyer Jeffrey Kessler said the company looked forward to pursuing its claims ""to vindicate the ability of U.S. soccer fans to enjoy live play of some of the best soccer teams in the world.""

With the groundstaff yet to confirm which of the two prepared pitches would be used, Australia's stand-in captain Steve Smith decided to delay naming their playing XI.

""We'll have a look (at the pitch on Wednesday) and we'll reassess, but it could be we name the team at the toss,"" Smith told reporters on Wednesday.

Smith will lead Australia again in the absence of regular skipper Pat Cummins who flew home after the second match in Delhi to be with his ailing mother in Sydney.

India retained the Border-Gavaskar trophy with back-to-back wins in Nagpur and Delhi but Smith says drawing the series would be no mean feat for his side.

""It'd be a huge achievement for the group, or any touring team that comes here to India and wins two test matches,"" Smith said.

The largest attendance for a single day of test cricket is 91,112 - a record set during the fourth game between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the 2013-14 Ashes series.

That could be shattered on Thursday when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after whom the 132,000 capacity stadium in Ahmedabad is named, welcomes his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese.

India, who are 2-1 ahead in the series, would need to win the match to seal their place in the final of the World Test Championship in June against Australia.

The U.S. currently bars unvaccinated foreigners from entry into the country, a policy that is expected to be lifted when the government ends its COVID-19 emergency declarations on May 11.

Djokovic, who missed last year's Australian Open after being deported from that country due to his vaccination status, has said he would skip Grand Slams rather than have a COVID shot.

He won his record-tying 22nd Grand Slam at the Australian Open in January. He has not played at Indian Wells or the Miami Open - which together comprise the ""Sunshine Double"" - since 2019.

Last week, Scott and fellow Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida also wrote to Biden urging him to grant the waiver request.

Indian Wells tournament director Tommy Haas, the United States Tennis Association and the U.S. Open were among those also hoping Djokovic would be allowed to enter.

""The only thing keeping Mr Djokovic from participating in this tournament is your administration's continued enforcement of a misguided, unscientific, and out-of-date COVID-19 vaccination requirement for foreign guests,"" DeSantis said.",[],

Wales players had threatened not to play against England last month to protest contract and other issues, but the strike was averted and the game went ahead as scheduled, with Wales suffering their third successive defeat at the tournament.

Wales remain at the bottom of the Six Nations standings without a point. They play away against Italy on Saturday.

""It is just unfortunate, and the situation we are all in at the moment is not great for anyone involved,"" number eight Faletau told British media on Tuesday. ""It's just a tough time we are stuck in at the moment.""

Welsh rugby remains challenged by financial problems as a deal between the governing WRU, Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets has yet to be agreed upon.

Those professional regions are facing major funding cuts that could lead to heavily-reduced contract offers for many players whose deals expire at the end of the season, while an exodus of players to clubs abroad is also a possibility.

""You are always going to try to put your best foot forward, but when things aren't going well off the pitch it's hard to give your all then,"" Faletau said.",[],

A full-fledged WPL kicked off on Saturday, 15 years after the launch of the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) for men, and Healy leads UP Warriorz in the five-team tournament.

The WPL is expected to be a game changer for the women's game after several female cricketers experienced the biggest payday of their careers at the auction, where teams had $1.45 million each to spend on acquiring players.

Reflecting Australia's dominance in women's cricket, Healy said the WBBL, an eight-team competition in Australia, would need to ensure it is lucrative enough to attract the best players.

""The WBBL has been the envy of women's cricket for eight years now, but there's no denying the WPL will put pressure on our domestic competition,"" Healy wrote in her column on Cricket Australia's website on Wednesday.

""It's not all about money, but players in the WPL are earning more for a three-week competition than they are playing for their country for 12 months of the year.

""For the WBBL to keep pace with the WPL and retain its status as the best domestic competition in the world, we need to make sure it's lucrative and exciting enough for the best players to keep making the trip to Australia.""

Healy added that Australia needed to start considering franchise cricket as an ""entertainment proposition"".

""I feel strongly that the WBBL should be about entertainment: our showpiece competition where fans pack out the hill and watch the best players in the world do battle,"" Healy said.",[],

Former Germany coach Klinsmann, 58, has signed a contract until the 2026 World Cup and succeeds Paulo Bento, who stepped down in December after South Korea's World Cup round of 16 defeat by Brazil in Qatar.

South Korea were the inaugural Asian Cup champions in 1956 and last won the competition when they retained the trophy as hosts in 1960. They have already qualified for the 2023 tournament in Qatar, which has been delayed until January.

""Our goal is to win the Asian Cup next year,"" Klinsmann told reporters, reeling off the names of previous South Korea coaches and their recent successes.

""When you have a team and a history for the last 20-25 years here that was built by coaches like Guus Hiddink, Uli Stielike, Paulo Bento, I think the goal has to be winning the Asian Cup,"" he said.

Dutch coach Hiddink led South Korea to the 2002 World Cup semi-finals. In December under Portuguese coach Bento, they stunned Portugal en route to reaching the final 16. South Korea also dumped former champions Germany out of the group stages in the 2018 World Cup.

""Winning is the goal because you proved in Qatar and you beat big nations, you beat Portugal in Qatar and four years ago you beat Germany so you can do very well,"" Klinsmann said.

""When this opportunity came up and we had to talk, I was very excited because I think it's a very good team.""

Klinsmann, who was announced as Bento's replacement last month, won the 1990 World Cup as a player and coached his native Germany to the semi-finals of the 2006 tournament.

He also managed his former club Bayern Munich before taking over as head coach of the U.S. national team from 2011-16. His last coaching role was a 10-week stint in charge of Bundesliga side Hertha Berlin in 2020.

The Hurricanes skipper drew his thumb across his throat as he exchanged words with Melbourne Rebels scrumhalf Ryan Louwrens during their Super Rugby match last weekend.

Loose forward Savea was sanctioned by a judicial panel on Tuesday for going ""against the spirit of good sportsmanship"".

""He accepted it pretty much straight away. When he was sitting in the sin bin for 10 minutes (he knew) it was something he shouldn’t have done,"" Hurricanes coach Jason Holland told New Zealand media.

""I’m aligned with him on that and to get the one-week sanction is the way it is and we accept it.

""Ardie was sorry and we just have to get on with accepting that and get on with what comes next.""

Savea's loss is a big blow for the undefeated Hurricanes who host last year's runnersup, the Auckland Blues, at home on Saturday.

Savea was instrumental in the 39-33 win over the Rebels in Melbourne, scoring two tries and setting up another for Josh Moorby before he was yellow-carded for his involvement in a melee.

Holland said he was not sure what led to Savea making the threatening gesture at Louwrens as he walked off to the sin bin.

""I don’t think there was any one thing - it was just a combination of how everything unfolded there with people running in from both sides and a bit of adrenaline going but as we’ve said, there’s no excuse for where we got to at the end of it,"" added Holland.

Dortmund won the first leg at home 1-0 but a first-half goal by Raheem Sterling and a controversial penalty by Havertz handed them a 2-0 defeat in the second leg at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday as they crashed out of the last 16 2-1 on aggregate.

Chelsea were given a penalty in the second half after a cross from Ben Chilwell smacked into the outstretched hand of Dortmund defender Marius Wolf.

Havertz hit the post from the spot but the penalty was re-taken after VAR alerted the referee that Dortmund players had encroached into the area. In his second try, Havertz went on to score, sending Chelsea into the quarter-finals.

""I'm not sure what more he can do with his hand,"" Bellingham told BT Sport, referring to Wolf. ""That in itself was disappointing and the fact that they've had a retake, I think it's a joke.

""For every penalty, especially when you have such a slow run-up, there's going to be people encroaching into the box by a yard or so. He has made the decision and we have to live with it.""

Dortmund coach Edin Terzic said his team would refrain from complaining.

""If a decision takes about five or six minutes then it's not easy to make a call,"" Terzic said.

Hamilton had been considered the frontrunner and preferred candidate to stage the centennial Games but was unable to obtain the required government backing by Commonwealth Sport Canada's February deadline.

The Hamilton100 bid proposed an operating budget of around C$1 billion CDN ($727 million), with the private sector kicking in between $250 million to $500 million.

""Commonwealth Sport Canada set an early deadline for provincial financial support and the province simply didn’t have sufficient time to make a commitment,"" Hamilton100 bid chief Louis Frapporti told Reuters on Tuesday.

""As a consequence Commonwealth Sport Canada jumped to Alberta, where they were prepared to make an early commitment to support the funding of bid preparation.

""It’s anyone’s guess whether they can finalise and submit a bid.

""Our provincial stakeholders remain interested in advancing a bid in the event that Alberta doesn’t get it across the line.""

Commonwealth Sport Canada and the Alberta 2030 Commonwealth Games Corporation have scheduled a press conference for Wednesday in Calgary to officially launch the exploration process.

Calgary hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics but saw hopes of bringing the 2026 Winter Games back to the western Canadian city dashed when citizens voted resoundingly against a bid.

Edmonton hosted the 1978 Commonwealth Games.

Chelsea fans, many of whom had booed Potter loudly when defeat followed defeat in recent weeks, cheered the team off the pitch after a goal by Raheem Sterling and a re-taken penalty by Kai Havertz earned the Blues a 2-0 win on the night.

That turned a 1-0 deficit in the first leg in Germany into a ticket for the quarter finals and kicked off celebrations that harked back to some of Chelsea's great nights in Europe's top competition over the past 20 years.

For Potter, the victory was personal too.

""Inevitably in life, you are going to have bad times and you're going to have good times,"" Potter told reporters when asked about how he felt after shouldering much of the blame for Chelsea's bleak run of form that began as far back as October.

""Things are never bad forever, thankfully. But it felt like that sometimes,"" he said.

Potter confirmed he had a quick post-match meeting with Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly who had been all smiles in the stands, wrapped in a blue and white scarf.

""I'm still here,"" Potter said about the outcome of the meeting, shrugging off with a laugh the speculation that his job was on the line depending on the result of Tuesday's match.

It was the biggest win yet for Chelsea's new owners who paid 4.25 billion pounds ($5.03 billion) last year for the 2021 European champions.

Since then, the consortium has invested more than 500 million pounds in new players, continuing the kind of lavish spending seen under the former owner of Stamford Bridge, Russian tycoon Roman Abramovich, who was forced to relinquish the club after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.

Until Tuesday's win, Boehly and the rest of the consortium had seen little return on their investment.

Chelsea have slumped to 10th place in the English Premier League, with their chances of reaching next season's Champions League via a top-four finish all but gone, and the team were eliminated early in both of England's knockout cup competitions.

The Blues struggled even to score during a miserable run of two wins in 15 games that was only ended last Saturday with a close-run 1-0 victory over struggling Leeds United.

Potter, who had to fill the big shoes of Champions League winner Thomas Tuchel when the German was fired last September, again told reporters after Tuesday's win that his job had been made harder by a long list of injuries in late 2022.

But the former Brighton & Hove Albion coach went out of his way to praise Chelsea fans, saying he understood their frustrations and appreciated the atmosphere they created in Stamford Bridge against Dortmund.

""Big thanks to the supporters. They were amazing tonight, they helped us on Saturday and they helped us this evening,"" Potter said. ""So it's brilliant for everyone connected with the club.""

The 41-year-old former Norway international said that she did not want to be appointed to the highest committee of European soccer's governing body, known as ExCo, and instead is aiming to break new ground by being elected by the other national associations.

""I'm the first female president to ever run for an ExCo election, which is pretty critical when you consider that it's the biggest sport for girls and women in the world, so we need a board that reflects that,"" she said in a telephone interview.

Part of the Norway team that finished fourth at the World Cup in China in 2007, Klaveness played 73 times for her country and served as Norway's technical director before being elected NFF president a year ago.

""Men's football is just as close to my heart as women's football, I find that technical competence has to be represented in the boardrooms, alongside business skills and entertainment skills and investment skills, but the technical aspect needs to be very well-represented, and I'm ready to do that,"" she said.

Having climbed to the highest post in her country's football association, Klaveness is looking for broader female representation across the board.

""I am for a system where you're elected because of merit, so the reason why I talk about female representation is that I think it's a very important thing for football structures,"" she explained when asked why other nations should vote for her.

GOOD INSIGHT

""I will be ready to do a good job in the ExCo because I have good insight to the game - I've spent my life in football, both on the women's and the men's side,"" she said.

""I was the first female to ever commentate on the men's game in Norway, on the World Cup and Premier League, and then the first technical director to lead the men's national team, and now the first female president.""

A qualified lawyer specialising in employment law, Klaveness gave a fiery speech at FIFA's congress in Doha in March last year, urging delegates to consider the situation of migrant workers and LGBT people ahead of the World Cup in Qatar, which took place in November and December.

While she says she has seen progress in football in terms of equality over the last two decades, the former midfielder said there is still work to be done.

""I definitely see the progress and it inspires me, but it does not change that, on some level, it's going the opposite direction - for example, gaps increasing between bonus payments between the men and women,"" she said.

The elections to UEFA's executive committee will take place at the governing body's congress in early April, and Klaveness is hoping that its members will be ready to give their votes to a female candidate.

""I think it's time, and it's an important step ... I think that, if we want diversity down the (football) pyramid, we need to walk the walk at the top level,"" she said.

The Olympic bronze medallist has already qualified for the World Athletics Championships in August and the renewal of the Ukraine Solidarity Fund, announced by the sport's global governing body on Wednesday, will help ease her road there.

The World Athletics backed fund distributed $220,000 to more than 100 Ukraine athletes in 2022.

Ryzhykova fled her eastern Ukraine home of Dnipro within weeks of Russia invading the country in February last year in what Moscow calls a ""special operation."" Her coach Volodymyr Kravchenko joined Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces.

""Every Ukrainian stood up to defend our homeland ... as is the case in sport,"" Ryzhykova told a small group of reporters on a call from Fort Worth, Texas, where she is temporarily living and training. ""By participating in competitions, we do not let the world forget about such a country as Ukraine.

""I continue to cry and worry every day about my friends, my family. But I still continue to train and still continue to show good results to help my country.""

The 33-year-old Ryzhykova was fifth in the 400 metres hurdles at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and won bronze at the 2012 London Olympics in the 4x400 relay.

FACILITIES DESTROYED

According to international athlete-led organisation Global Athlete, since the invasion 343 sport facilities have been destroyed, leaving an estimated 140,000 young athletes without facilities, while 40,000 athletes are training abroad.

The figures cover all sports.

Ryzhykova spent many weeks each year training at a top athletics facility in Bakhmut.

Russian forces have been waging an intense campaign for months to seize control of the small city and secure Moscow its first battlefield victory in more than half a year.

""Now it is destroyed, and the city is under fire for the last many months,"" said Ryzhykova.

The financial help to train and compete abroad is crucial since ""sports bases have been destroyed, there are constant threats of rocket attacks, we live in fear,"" she added.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last month that 228 Ukrainian athletes had been killed in the war.

RUSSIAN STRIKE

Ukraine's high jumper Kateryna Tabashnyk dedicated her bronze medal at this month's European Indoor Championships to her mother, who was killed in a Russian strike in August, saying: ""This medal carries all my pain and sorrow.""

Ryzhykova, who also fears children will never know the joy of sports having lived so much of their young lives in bomb shelters, said she hopes no one ever feels her sense of despair.

""You forget about your career, about your dreams and you think about how to survive and how to help your family and friends to survive, and the World Athletics Solidarity Fund really saved our athletes' careers, and gave us a chance to fight for our country in our own way,"" she said.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is facing a major backlash after opening the door for athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete at next year's Paris Olympics.

Belarus has been a key staging area for Russia's invasion.

""They're killing my friends, my friends' relatives, many of my friends go to war, also a number of athletes were killed by Russians,"" Ryzhykova said. ""I can't even imagine how to be near the person who supports the war or keeps silent.""

Ryzhykova added that she would support a Ukraine boycott of the Paris Games, but hopes the IOC bans Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing there instead.

Ryzhykova is a member of World Athletics' athletes commission and has pledged to run for a WA administrative position in the future.

Among its steps toward gender equity, World Athletics is set to have 40 per cent female participation and at least one female vice-president on the World Athletics Council this year.

It is targeting 40 per cent female participation in online courses as part of a learning pipeline for future administrators.

World Athletics also plans to expand research into representation of female athletes across media channels.

And it has set a deadline of the end of 2023 for all 214 global member federations to implement safeguarding policies.

World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said gender equity was an important part of reforms introduced in 2016.

""In today's world, it is not enough to provide equal opportunity, we must provide equity,"" he said in a statement.

""In order to achieve true equity in our sport, it is important that we offer our female athletes, administrators, and officials the tools and environment they need to be empowered to pursue careers at all levels of athletics.""",[],

The hosts were initially frustrated by their struggling visitors but goals by Bukayo Saka and Martinelli shortly before halftime put them in command as they took maximum advantage of their game in hand over Manchester City.

Captain Martin Odegaard made it 3-0 with a close-range finish in the 71st minute before Brazilian Martinelli grabbed his second to complete the rout.

A third victory in succession since losing at home to City lifted Mikel Arteta's side to 60 points from 25 games with champions City on 55.

Everton, who now have only one victory from their last 27 league visits to Arsenal, had actually looked capable of taking something from the game. But once they fell behind a 14th league defeat of the season was almost a formality.

They remained third from bottom with 21 points having played a game more than all the teams around them.

While Everton are haunted by the looming prospect of a first relegation from the Premier League, Arsenal are beginning to envisage a first title since 2004, although they still have to visit Manchester City in April.

""I am delighted with the win and the way we played after the first 25 minutes. We had some difficulties at the start,"" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said.

""Once we scored the first goal, the game unlocked. We needed a magic moment and Bukayo produced that. After that we grew and deserved to win the game.

""We played really well in the second half and could have scored more.""

Everton stunned Arsenal 1-0 in Sean Dyche's first game in charge in early February and for 40 minutes they did an extremely effective job at nullifying them again.

But with halftime looming they caved in.

Dangerman Saka had been relatively quiet but he burst into life to make the breakthrough.

Given far too much time to turn after receiving a pass from Odegaard on the right edge of the penalty area, he smashed an angled shot into the roof of the net.

Everton's Idrissa Gueye gifted Arsenal a second on the stroke of halftime. The Senegalese midfielder was caught napping by Saka who nicked the ball away from him before poking a pass to Martinelli who slipped his shot past Jordan Pickford.

The visitors thought they had been spared by an offside flag but a VAR decision overturned it and Arsenal went in at halftime to chants of ""we are top of the league"" from the home fans.

With only 17 league goals all season it looked a tall order for shot-shy Everton to salvage anything and they offered next to nothing after the break.

Odegaard fired in his side's third from Leandro Trossard's cut back and Martinelli confirmed the gulf between the sides late on by tapping in from Eddie Nketiah's assist.",[],

Liverpool climbed into sixth spot in the table on 39 points, ahead of Fulham on goal difference and with a game in hand, but the home side were forced to work hard on a rainy night at Anfield.

""We controlled the game without creating massively, but we found our rhythm back,"" Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp said in a TV interview as his side claimed their third win in an unbeaten four-game Premier League run.

Despite fashioning the first effort on goal in the game, the visitors suffered an early blow when left back Hugo Bueno went down clutching his hamstring midway through the first half and was replaced by Rayan Ait-Nouri.

The best chances of the opening 45 minutes fell to teenaged Liverpool midfielder Harvey Elliott, who steered a header just wide in the 39th minute and followed that up with a bouncing stoppage-time shot that was turned away for a corner.

The 19-year-old was in the thick of things again 10 minutes into the second half, controlling a firm pass from Darwin Nunez and firing another shot goalwards, but again it lacked the necessary power and precision and was easily saved by Jose Sa.

Nunez had the ball in the net for the home side in the 66th minute after a surging run by Diogo Jota, but the Portuguese striker was deemed to have fouled Max Kilman in the build-up after a VAR review and the goal was chalked off.

Van Dijk finally broke the deadlock in the 73rd minute, forcing a save with his initial header from a set-piece, before Jota put the rebound back across the goal for the Dutchman to head home from close range.

Four minutes later Salah used his right thigh to steer home a cross from Kostas Tsimikas to double his side's advantage and take the wind out of the visitors' sails as Liverpool cruised to victory, much to the delight of the home fans.

""You have to break an opponent down step by step, it's not often they make mistakes and you get easy goals in the 420 or something games I've had here,"" Klopp said.

The 22-times Grand Slam champion was in no mood to waste any more time after a couple of short delays due to light rain as he attacked his Dutch opponent's serve early in the next set.

Firing winners at will from the baseline, the Serbian also showed soft hands with a vintage drop shot and followed it up with a stunning pass at the net before surging to a 4-0 lead.

Griekspoor managed to win a game and world number one Djokovic dropped serve with a double fault before sealing victory in style.

""It's been a great evening for me. Yesterday, I really had to work hard to get a win,"" Djokovic said.

""Tonight, right from the beginning I was sharp. I played better quality tennis. Maybe the last three or four games were not the best to close the match but I managed to find the good serve in the end.

The sweeping changes, which were outlined in a letter sent to PGA Tour members by Commissioner Jay Monahan, do not apply to all elevated events as the four majors, The Players Championship and three FedExCup playoff events will be unaffected.

""These smaller, designated event fields will not only deliver substantial, can't-miss tournaments to our fans at important intervals throughout the season, but they will also enhance the quality of full-field events,"" wrote Monahan.

""Together, this approach provides a schedule that is cohesive, compelling, consequential and with clarity for fans, players and sponsors alike.""

According to the memo, select designated events in 2024 will feature limited fields of between 70 to 80 players with no cuts taking place after 36 holes and with opportunities for in-form players from full-field events to qualify and compete.

By comparison, last month's Phoenix Open, which was the PGA Tour's first fully-fledged designated event, had a field of 136 golfers that was cut to 66 after the second round.

Designated events were announced by the PGA Tour last August to get the best players competing against each other more often. The move came amid the threat posed by LIV Golf, which features limited-field, 54-hole events with no cuts and guaranteed prize money for each golfer.

""Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Congratulations PGA Tour. Welcome to the future,"" read a message posted on LIV Golf's Twitter account on Wednesday as news of the PGA Tour's designated event changes circulated online.

""FAIR SHAKE""

Starting next year, designated events will include the top 50 players from the previous year's FedExCup regular season list along with the top 10 players not otherwise eligible from the current points list.

Other qualification criteria include performance in non-designated events, consideration of the world rankings and sponsor exemptions for some PGA Tour members.

World number three Rory McIlroy, speaking to reporters ahead of this week's Arnold Palmer Invitational, said the changes will make the PGA Tour more competitive.

""I'm all about rewarding good play. ... I want to give everyone a fair shake at this. Which I think this structure has done. There's ways to play into it,"" McIlroy, who also holds a position on the PGA Tour's Player Advisory Council, said at Bay Hill in Orlando, Florida.

""It's trying to get the top guys versus the hot guys, right? I think that creates a really compelling product. But a way that you don't have to wait an entire year for your good play to then get the opportunity. That opportunity presents itself straight away.""

Max Homa, ranked eighth in the world and also a member of the Player Advisory Council, acknowledged the emergence of LIV Golf, which has lured many big names from the PGA Tour, may have forced the U.S.-based circuit to rethink things.

""One of the things that they have that's great that this will provide now is a guaranteed product. You know who is going to be at each event,"" said Homa.

""I don't think we would be here this soon without LIV, but I would hope at some point we would have looked at this and said, Hey, there might be a better way to do it.""",[],

Russian athletes have been banned from many sports and largely cannot compete in Europe due to the sanctions and competition complications caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb 24, 2022.

However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) last month urged sports federations to create a pathway for Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to international competitions in Asia.

This pathway would also give those athletes the chance to qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympics through Asian qualifying events as they are unable to compete in Europe.

Belarus is also under Western sanctions because it has allowed Russia to use its territory as a key staging area for the invasion.

""This day witnessed a historic event: A chess federation, one of the strongest in the world, has moved from one continent to another for the first time ever,"" Russian chess federation president Andrey Filatov said on Tuesday (Feb 28) following the ACF vote in Abu Dhabi.

""We are grateful to the delegates for having supported our transition to the ACF at the Continental Assembly by a majority of votes. It goes to show the amount of trust in us on the one hand, and the good work achieved by our federation on the other.""

Of the 36 votes, 29 ACF delegates voted in favour of Russia's inclusion and one voted against, while there were also six abstentions, with the result sealing Russia's departure from the European Chess Union.

Many countries have publicly opposed the IOC's plan to see a return of Russian and Belarusian athletes in international competitions, while Ukraine has threatened to boycott the Paris Olympics if Russians are allowed to compete, even as neutral athletes with no flag or anthem, as proposed.

In response to queries from CNA, the Singapore Chess Federation (SCF) said that it was one of the six that abstained from the vote.

""This decision was arrived at after an internal discussion within our executive council and after seeking the advice of Sport Singapore,"" said SCF CEO Kevin Goh.

""Russia is a traditional powerhouse in chess and we look forward to their contributions to chess development in this region.""",[],

Fontaine achieved the record during the 1958 finals in Sweden, where France reached the semi-finals for the first time in their history.

To this day, only three players have scored more World Cup goals than Fontaine, even though the Reims player appeared at just one tournament and played only six matches.

Lionel Messi matched his tally on Argentina's recent run to glory in Qatar, but it took him five World Cups to get there.

That 1958 World Cup in Sweden is best remembered as the coming of age of a 17-year-old Pele, who inspired Brazil to victory after netting a hat-trick in their 5-2 semi-final win over France.

However, it was a personal triumph for Fontaine, whose four-goal haul in the third-place playoff win over West Germany ensured that he had scored in every game.

Part of a wonderful attacking trident alongside Roger Piantoni and Raymond Kopa, Fontaine might never have gone to Sweden at all.

Only injuries to Thadee Cisowski and his Reims teammate Rene Bliard saw him make the squad and then the starting line-up.

""It was only at the airport before leaving for Sweden that Paul Nicolas (part of the national team staff) and Albert Batteux (the France coach), who didn't really want me, told me I would be playing as centre-forward,"" Fontaine told AFP in 2013.

Only Germany's Miroslav Klose (16), Brazil's Ronaldo (15) and Gerd Muller, the West German hero of the 1970s who scored 14 times, have netted more World Cup finals goals.

Just two other players - Muller with 10 in 1970 and Hungary's Sandor Kocsis with 11 in 1954 - have reached double figures at a single World Cup.

Yet, Kopa is remembered as the biggest French star of the era. When he died in 2017, Fontaine remembered fondly his ""big brother"".

""Raymond had character,"" he said. ""So did I, and that made us a magical duo.""

Born in Marrakech in August 1933 to a French father and Spanish mother at the time of the French Protectorate in Morocco, Fontaine went to school in Casablanca, and began his football career there.",[],

South Africa limped to 49 for four in their second innings having been all out for 342 in their first early on the second morning.

They dismissed West Indies for 212 in reply as seamer Gerald Coetzee also claimed figures of 2-45 on debut, with 24 wickets already lost in six sessions in the match.

Dean Elgar (1), debutant Tony de Zorzi (0), Keegan Petersen (7) and Temba Bavuma (0), with a pair of ducks, are all already dismissed for the home side in their second innings.

Bavuma is the fourth player to get a pair on their test captaincy debut after Mark Taylor, Rashid Latif and Habibul Bashar.

First innings centurion Aiden Markram (35 not out) and Heinrich Klaasen (0 not out) will resume on the third morning, hoping to build on what is already a sizeable advantage.

Seamer Alzarri Joseph (2-17) has impressed again after he claimed a maiden test five-wicket haul in South Africa's first innings with 5-81.

""It's not the quickest wicket, it's going a little up and down, but we are just sticking to our plans,"" Nortje said. ""I need to adjust a little now and then. It's just about finding that rhythm.

""We need some sort of partnership to take the lead to 250-plus. Definitely that's very competitive. The more we can get the better, but I would think 250-plus is a very good score.""

West Indies made a strong start to their first innings but lost their final seven wickets for 43 runs as Nortje proved chief destroyer.

Kagiso Rabada (2-44) claimed the first wicket with a beautiful delivery that angled into captain Kraigg Brathwaite (11) and then seamed away off the pitch and hit the top of off-stump.

Tagenarine Chanderpaul (22), son of West Indies great Shivnarine, was caught by Senuran Muthusamy at gully to give Coetzee his first test wicket.

The visitors showed some dogged determination in the face of hostile home bowling and Blackwood reached 37 before an inside edge off Nortje was caught by diving wicketkeeper Klaasen.

The Brumbies dominated their Australian rivals last year but fell short in a 20-19 thriller at Eden Park as the Blues booked their place in the final against the eventual champion Canterbury Crusaders.

The Blues have won their last 14 regular season matches, including last week's 60-20 hiding of the Otago Highlanders in their season-opener in Dunedin.

The Brumbies, however, have proved tough foes for the Blues and head into Sunday's afternoon clash at the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium confident after a solid 31-25 win over the improving New South Wales Waratahs.

""We know the Brumbies will bring a physical, confronting game and we have been preparing all week to meet that challenge,"" Blues captain Dalton Papalii said.

All matches will be played at the Rectangular Stadium in three consecutive days of double-headers as part of the competition's ""Super Round"".

The Crusaders, who face the Otago Highlanders on Friday, might welcome the chance to play in a city where rugby is barely on the radar given the media storm over the All Blacks' coaching situation back home.

Within six weeks, Crusaders' coach Scott Robertson is expected to be confirmed as Ian Foster's successor as All Blacks coach after the World Cup in France, regardless of the application process announced by New Zealand Rugby (NZR) on Wednesday.

The Crusaders were upset 31-10 by the Waikato Chiefs in a major shock at home last weekend, and Robertson will not want another defeat on his ledger before interviews with NZR.

He will have veteran All Blacks lock Sam Whitelock back in the side fore the Highlanders clash and has restored the formidable midfield partnership of David Havili and Jack Goodhue after using Havili at fullback last week.

The Wellington Hurricanes will look to back up their impressive 47-13 win away to the Queensland Reds when they meet the home team, Melbourne Rebels, on Friday.

Hurricanes winger Julian Savea scored his 58th try against the Reds and can match Israel Folau's all-time Super Rugby record with a double against the Rebels.

The Waratahs experimented with dual opensides in their back row against the Brumbies but ditched that after one match, dropping Charlie Gamble to the bench for their match against Fijian Drua on Saturday.

The Western Force, meanwhile, have promoted comeback king Jeremy Thrush to their starting lineup for Sunday's match against the Reds after the 37-year-old lock scored the winning try off the bench against the Rebels last week.

Thrush retired in the off-season but was coaxed back to the game after an injury to Izack Rodda.

A knee issue has long bothered Stokes and he has come under pressure in some quarters to rest the joint and skip his lucrative stint in the IPL with the Chennai Super Kings from the end of the month.

McCullum, however, said the all-rounder had built a career on peaking in big moments and the Ashes series against Australia in June and July would be no different.

""I ... believe that the Ashes is the script that the skipper is waiting to write, so he'll be sweet. I don't have any concerns,"" he told reporters in Wellington at the conclusion of the drawn series with New Zealand.

""I don't think he's jeopardising it. I know that Chennai set-up, I played for that franchise, and it is excellent in looking after the players.

""He knows how to get right for the big moments. His life is that, right? When he comes back into the fold and leads us into the Ashes campaign, he'll have the bit between his teeth and I think we'll be all right.""

Stokes has already said he will leave the IPL early to prepare for a one-off test against Ireland at Lord's on June 1 and the first Ashes test at Edgbaston, which starts on Jun 16.

McCullum and Stokes have led England to 10 wins in 12 tests since taking over early last year on the back of an entertaining style of play dubbed ""Bazball"" after the coach's nickname.

The second defeat came in the most dramatic of circumstances on Tuesday when New Zealand triumphed by a single run to become only the fourth team to win a test after being asked to follow on.

McCullum, like Stokes, was unapologetic for the decision to enforce the follow on and said there was unlikely to be much change to the way England approached the game.

""I think there'll be tens of millions of people around the world that sat back and enjoyed that test match,"" he added.

""Now we have the opportunity to really ... turn our attention to what's going to be a pretty amazing time in the guys' lives - an Ashes series at home against a good Australian side.

""We'll go into it with a lot of confidence.

Two penalties netted by Gavan Holohan either side of halftime sealed a 2-1 victory on one of the biggest nights in Grimsby's history and their reward is a trip to top-flight Brighton and Hove Albion in the last eight - a clash destined to be billed as the Seagulls versus Haddocks.

Manager Paul Hurst described it as a 'miracle' as his side became only the sixth team from the fourth tier or below to reach the last eight of the FA Cup Cup since the introduction of the division in 1958-59.

Both charges are misdemeanors punishable by up to a $1,000 fine and one year in jail.

""It is my understanding that Mr. Carter is making arrangements to turn himself in. At this time, no other charges are pending,"" Lt. Shaun Barnett of the Athens-Clarke County Police Department told Field Level Media on Wednesday.

Carter, 21, was interviewed by police and told authorities he wasn't present at the time of the accident, according to the police report.

But details of the arrest warrant, citing video recorded before the crash, allege Carter was the driver of a 2021 Jeep Trailhawk that pushed LeCroy, who was driving a 2021 Ford Expedition, to speeds exceeding 100 mph.

""The investigation found that (Carter and LeCroy) were operating their vehicles in a manner consistent with racing shortly after leaving the downtown Athens area at about 2:30 AM,"" the warrant from Athens-Clarke County Policy Department said Wednesday. ""The evidence demonstrated that both vehicles switched between lanes, drove in the center turn lane, drove in the opposite lanes of travel, overtook other motorists, and drove at high rates of speed, in an apparent attempt to outdistance each other. Evidence indicate shortly before the crash the Expedition was traveling about 104 miles per hour. The toxicology report indicated that LeCroy's blood alcohol concentration was .197 at the time of the crash. Investigators determined that alcohol impairment, racing, reckless driving and speed were significant contributing factors to the crash.""

The legal blood alcohol concentration limit in Georgia is 0.08 per cent.

Police said the case was given to the Solicitor General's Office on Wednesday.

The report was released just 20 minutes before Carter was scheduled to take the podium in a press conference setting at the 2023 NFL Scouting Combine. Carter is ranked among the top players in the draft and considered a likely top-5 pick in April.

Carter never took the podium because he reportedly left town on Tuesday night.

He was in Indianapolis on Monday and Tuesday and met with teams in formal interviews before the warrant was issued.

Georgia head coach Kirby Smart said his program is still mourning the loss of a player and staff member.

""The charges announced today are deeply concerning, especially as we are still struggling to cope with the devastating loss of two beloved members of our community,"" Smart said in a statement released Wednesday.

""We will continue to cooperate fully with the authorities while supporting these families and assessing what we can learn from this horrible tragedy.""

The warrant was issued just as former Georgia linebacker Nolan Smith was at a podium in Indianapolis in a press conference. He was asked about the crash that killed Willock, who was a good friend.

That's my guy,"" Smith said before emotions began to overtake him, causing his hands and lips to quiver. ""I get sensitive talking about it just because I love him. And he never did anything wrong in his three years. He was supposed to graduate. Most people don't know his brother passed like that. No one should deserve to die like that.""

Smith shook his head as he continued, banging the lectern and removing his steamed glasses from his face covered in tears.

""Three years in a row, that man showed up (and) worked day in and day out. He's a two-time natty champ, man. And it's written in stone. Devin, I love you, baby. Seven-seven (Willock's jersey number), you living forever. 'Do it for Dev,' that's what I tell them boys at Georgia. 'You lost a brother. Do it for Dev.' I'm sorry to get emotional, man.""

Police said Carter also was ticketed in September for driving 89 mph in a 45 mph zone.
